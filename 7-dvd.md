00:27 **Original location of the _All You Need Is Love_ sequence, moved to the [end of Episode 6](#6&dvd90) in the Disney+ version.**

06:54 John: "I still believe all you need is love, y'know, but I don't believe that just saying it is gonna do it, y'know, I mean I still believe in the fact that love is what we all need."

07:06 Ringo: "**And it was for love, it was for love and bloody peace again, it was a fabulous time. That's what it meant to me,** I even get excited now when I realize that's what it was for, people putting flowers in guns, San Francisco was just exploding, here was fabulous, California, where we are, LA, it was just exciting times and all for this loving feeling."

07:33 Paul: "And music, the whole rest of it was just music..." up to George: "You could just pick up the vibes, y'know."

07:50 George: "Everywhere we went people were smiling and sitting on lawns drinking tea, festivals of music and stuff. That summer of love, a lot of that was bullshit really, it was all what the press were saying. But it was definitely a vibe. In America we could feel what was going on there even though we were miles away. You could just pick up the vibes, y'know."

08:20 John: "I was all for going there and living on the Haight, y'know..." up to "George went over."

08:32 George: "Y'know, I went to Haight-Ashbury expecting it to be this brilliant place. And it was just full of **horrible, spotty** dropout kids on drugs.

08:45 _Eight Miles High_ over a slow-mo montage of Haight-Ashbury flower children.

09:09 George: "It certainly showed me what was really happening in the drug cult..." up to "You should come and get initiated."

11:42 Ringo: "And at that time, Maureen was in hospital having Jason, I was visiting. And I came home, y'know, I put on the answer phone. Even in those days we had answer phones. The message from John, "Oh man, we've seen this guy and we're all going to Wales, you've got to come." The next message was George saying, "Wow, man, we've seen this guy, Maharishi's great, we're all going to Wales on Saturday, you've got to come."

12:15 Reporter to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi: "The Beatles seem to among your supporters now, how do you feel about that?"

12:20 Maharishi: "I feel a great promise for the younger generation because if they take up this transcendental meditation, they are the ideal of energy and intelligence in the younger generation, and that will really bring up the youth on a very good level of understanding and intelligence."

12:38 Maharishi: "I'm very happy about it, that they heard my lecture last evening..." up to Paul: "You ought to get it, I'll send you a copy."

12:58 Paul: "Sort of, that kind of thing, you ought to, come on, he's going to be there, come with us. We got up there, there was a big crowd at the train station. There was a crowd to meet us and we all sort of wandered through in our psychedelic gear. It was like a summer camp."

13:13 Paul: "It was like a school that they've taken over..." up to John: "You don't will it or use your willpower."

14:22 George: "I seem to recall it was a phone call. That somebody came to us in this place in Bangor and said -"

14:39 Paul: "**That he died,** that was kind of stunning because we were off on this sort of finding the meaning of life. And there he was, dead."

14:45 Neil Aspinall: "I heard it, I heard it on the radio, actually, on the car radio, that he died."

14:51 George Martin: "The local shopkeeper said, sorry about the news. I said what news? He said your friend's died."

14:58 Ringo: "Our friend is gone."

15:00 John: "Well, I don't know what to say, y'know..." up to "I mean, it's only just, we've only just heard."

15:20 Ringo: "Yes, y'know, it's much news to us as it is to everybody else."

15:24 George: "I spoke to him Wednesday evening, the evening before we first saw Maharishi's lecture..." up to Paul: "Oh, I'm not gonna see him any more."

16:13 George: "And it was just, y'know, blood drained from the face, y'know, saying, 'Brian's dead.' And there was very little we knew other than that he'd been found dead. And we just knew, 'Well, that's it, we gotta...' It was very strange for it to happen at that precise moment, we'd just got involved with this meditation."

16:39 Ringo: "Your belief system gets suspended because you don't want to hear it so bad. I don't know, you don't know what to do with it anyway. If you look at our faces in the film, we're all a bit like, "What does it mean, y'know?"

16:54 Ringo: "Our friend is gone, y'know. More our friend than anything else, y'know. Brian was a friend of ours."

17:02 Paul: "I don't think there was anything sinister..." up to Ringo: "I don't think any of them set out to die."

18:00 Reporter: "Have you a tribute you'd like to pay to Mr. Epstein?"

18:04 John: "Well, y'know, we don't know what to say. We loved him and he was one of us. So you can't, y'know..."

18:10 George: "We can't pay tribute to him in words."

18:13 _You've Got To Hide Your Love Away_, an early take, not the released version, complete song.

20:20 John: "I knew that we were in trouble then."

20:30 John: "I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music..." up to George: "I suppose it was chaos after that."

21:07 Paul: "We were kind of managing ourselves, really. It was sad, y'know, it was very sad to lose an old mate, under those circumstances,
but I don't think the major worry was, 'Oh, what are we going to do now? We haven't got a manager,' because I say we'd been moving away from that."

21:22 Neil Aspinall: "What we really decided was we had to keep on trucking, right, because we'd obviously, they'd always discussed whatever they were doing with Brian, right. Now there was nobody. There was Brian's organisation, right, but we hadn't related to that, we'd only ever related to Brian."

21:44 Ringo: "We're suddenly like chickens without heads. What are we going to do? What are we going to do?"

21:49 George: "Y'know, that's where Neil kind of stepped in and tried to figure out what was happening."

21:54 Neil Aspinall: "As far as I was concerned, we had to get it together... What were the Beatles going to do?"

22:16 Neil Aspinall: "And so there was a lot of, y'know, different sets of advice coming in at them about what they should do. But we decided we needed an office and an organisation of our own. And that's really why we expanded Apple, because Apple already existed.
I think it was a publishing company in an office on Baker Street."

22:43 John: "Paul made an attempt to carry on as if Brian hadn't died. I think Paul had an impression, we should be thankful for what he did, for keeping the Beatles going."

22:54 Paul: "**At some point, y'know,** I know John got a bit annoyed, **sort of saying, y'know, Paul's trying to be the leader of the group and stuff.** It's possible that I was there more than anyone. Y'know, that I was, I mean, when we did Magical Mystery Tour, for instance, I ended up kind of directing it, even though we said, well, the Beatles have directed at the end, **just because I was there most of the time in all the late night chats with the cameramen, about what we're going to do tomorrow, would tend to be me rather than the others.**"

23:21 _Magical Mystery Tour_

24:00 George: "It was Paul's idea... It was a very flimsy kind of thing."

24:31 Neil Aspinall: "I think it was Paul's idea. I know that he and John sat down, I think in Paul's place in St. John's Wood, and they just like drew a circle, and then marked it off like the spokes on the wheel, and it was really, y'know, we can have a song here, y'know, we can have this here, we can have this dream sequence there, we can have that there, and they sort of mapped it out, but it was pretty rough."

25:01 John: "And then he came and showed me what his idea was, and this is how it went, it went round like this, the story and he had it all, y'know, in production, and he said, well here's the segment, you write a little piece for that."

25:11 Ringo: "In my brain it was Paul's idea, he came with a piece of paper, it was just a great way we used to work."

25:17 Paul: "I'm not sure, it could have been mine, I'm not sure whether, I want to take the blame for it, y'know, we were all in on it. But a lot of that stuff at that time could have been my ideas, because I was coming up with a lot of sort of concepts, like, y'know, Sergeant Pepper, and we could pretend to not be, and I'm not saying it was my album, obviously we all worked on all the stuff, but I was coming up with a lot of ideas."

25:40 Ringo: "I remember Paul saying, y'know, because to get the actors, we looked through the actor's book, the spotlight, or whatever. Oh, we need someone like that, and someone like that. And we needed the large lady as my auntie, because I was going to play this person with his auntie."

25:56 _You Made Me Love You_ sung in the coach by Jessie Robins

26:32 Paul: "We knew we weren't doing a regular film..." up to _The Fool on the Hill_.

28:04 George: "I remember quite a bit of it, really, in the big hangar down in Kent driving around this field in the Mini Cooper. _Your Mother Should Know_, that was quite interesting. I quite enjoyed that."

28:23 _Your Mother Should Know_

29:49 George: "But, you see, there was always good songs. There was a couple of good songs. And there was a few funny scenes. I mean, the scene, to me, that stands out is the one of John shovelling the spaghetti onto the fat woman's plate. I mean, that was the best bit of the movie for me."

30:11 Paul: "That was an actual dream he'd had..." up to Ringo: "Who do they think they are? What does it mean?"

31:31 Ringo: "So that was really slated, but of course when people started seeing it in colour... " up to Neil Aspinall: "I think under all the circumstances it really turned out very well."

32:31 Paul: "I think we thought it was okay, I think looking back on it, I think we were quite pleased with it. At the time, it was all right, y'know, it wasn't the greatest thing we'd ever done. I defend it on the lines that nowhere else do you see a performance of _I Am The Walrus_, that's the only performance ever. **So things like that I think are enough to make it an interesting film.**"

32:49 John on the Dennis Elsas show, WNEW-FM in New York on September 28, 1974: "And now we're going to play a track from Magical Mystery Tour, which is one of my favourite albums, because it was so weird. And it's _I Am The Walrus_, it's also one of my favorite tracks, because I did it of course. But also because it's one of those that has enough little bitties going to keep you interested even a hundred years later."

33:26 _I Am The Walrus_, complete song.

37:13 A subdued Ed Sullivan: "We brought the Beatles to America in 1963, now they can't be with us in person on our show on December 10th, when CBS and Mayor Lindsay are going to be naming this theatre after our show, but they sent this cablegram from London and I'd like to read it to you. 'Dear Ed, winter has come once again to our Great Britain. We sit by our fires, warming our feet, stop. We send all love to you and everyone looking in. We are happy to be on your show, you too... Stop, have a beautiful Christmas and a sincere New Year, Love the Beatles.' Now, it's signed by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison. But tonight, although they can't be here, here are the Beatles on film."

38:00 _Hello Goodbye_ promo film, significantly slower and thus lower in pitch than the released version.

41:30 A more cheerful Ed Sullivan: "That was very, very thoughtful of the guys to prepare that for us. Incidentally, _Hello Goodbye_ is their latest hit record."

41:45 A black-and-white news report about the opening of the Apple Boutique, briefly interrupted at 41:54 by the end of _Hello Goodbye_ and a montage of colour exterior photos of the newly decorated building. The report resumes at 42:09.

42:57 George: "Apart from the loony clothes and the kind of hippie flower power stuff, there was supposed to be all kinds of different music which now they'd call world music. That's what we're supposed to do and sell all these books about various things that we were into, various art or spiritual things and incense and y'know whatever, all that kind of stuff. It kind of looked quite good."

43:29 Paul: "The building was very nice and the painting was gorgeous. The Fool did that. There was a group of artists basically from Holland put this beautiful big mural on the wall. But the council got all their knickers in a twist and said no you've got to paint it white again. We said are you kidding? It's beautiful. Everyone loves it. Some residents probably objected. So then we were going to project it, paint it white and project it from the opposite, y'know it was all full of that. It was good ideas y'know. Some of them you just didn't do. You never got round to them. But it was a great ideas time."

44:06 Bob Danvers-Walker for [Pathe News](https://youtu.be/aLeBZjPOJ-c): "Far from the noise and pace of city life in the cool clear air of Rishikesh..." up to John: "They call it the foothills hanging over the Ganges."

45:06 _Across the Universe_, Anthology 2 version, Rishikesh home movies.

47:05 Ringo: "It was pretty exciting, y'know, we're in this really, a spiritual place..." up to _Dear Prudence_.

48:57 Paul: "I wrote a couple of little things, **Donovan was there, that reminds me, of Donovan, because I remember,** I had a song called _I Will_."

49:03 _I Will_, curiously beginning with a shot of Paul playing what appears to be a left-handed guitar that he has turned over into a right-handed configuration: the neck is to his left and the pick guard is above the soundhole. The long shot at 49:27 has the guitar the right way round. The shot at 49:34 (with John standing) has the guitar reversed again, and background details appear mirrored compared to the long shot.

49:38 The Threetles in George's garden, up to George: "just to put his toe in the water and see what it was like, maybe. **And Paul just came and went. [Note: Paul and Jane stayed for over a month]**"

52:28 John: "We were there four months, or George and I were **[Note: actually two months]**, we lost 13 pounds and we looked a day older," up to Neil Aspinall: "You must diversify, one of those."

53:07 Paul: "So the big theory was that we'd put all our affairs into sort of one bundle. We'd have it as our own company. Apple would be a record label, all the things we'd ever wanted to do."

53:18 Derek Taylor: "They all rang from England one morning, morning my time, and said, 'We're starting this company, Apple.' So we went to live in Surrey, and I worked for Apple, became Apple press officer again."

53:35 Ringo: "The sole purpose of Apple was not to, people didn't have to beg any more. Artists, if they had a valid idea. We would front them. And, y'know, we had a publishing company, a record company, and we would, we could use that in these companies. But, y'know, we should have had a big sign, 'You don't have to beg.'"

53:56 Paul: "The idea was we'd go to America and we'd say 'Apple is starting. Send us your huddled talent.' And we were interested. So we wanted a nice big launch. I had sort of a strange feeling. I was very nervous. I had like a real sort of personal paranoia on me. I don't know if it was what I was smoking at the time, but it was very strange, that for me. And I remember sitting up there and being interviewed, and John was doing great, and he had a bus driver or prefect badge. He was wearing it and he said, 'What's that mean?'"

54:31 Reporter at press conference: "Mr. Lennon, can you tell us what it is you're wearing, that button and those -"

54:35 John: "Well, it's just a white button, and that's bus prefect."

54:40 Reporter: "And that's what?"

54:42 John: "Bus prefect, bus prefect, in charge of the bus."

54:45 Neil Aspinall: "And then they went on the Johnny Carson show, but Johnny Carson wasn't there, it was Joe Dimento, I think, was the guy, because Johnny was on holiday. And, y'know, it was John, y'know, I think one of the things John said on that show was like, y'know, 'We'll just spin it like a top and see where it goes.'"

55:07 Interviewer: "What do you see in the years ahead, for yourself?"

55:10 Paul: "Oh, now y'know, an expanding vista."

55:12 John: "Apple, y'know, try and set it up and then see where it goes, like a top, and we set it going and hope for the best."

55:20 Neil Aspinall: "That, that was pretty much what happened, actually."

55:24 George: "**We had some kind of ideas on, 'Wouldn't it be nice if,' y'know,** because we got screwed in business all the time, and, y'know, how you have to go down on your knees. That was the famous one that John said, y'know, we don't want people to have to go down on their knees."

55:40 John (at press conference): "**It's a business concerning records, films and electronics, and as a sideline, whatever it's called, manufacturing or whatever. But** we want to set up a system whereby people who just want to make a film..." up to Paul: "Peter Asher brought along James Taylor."

56:36 Derek Taylor: "Yes, well, when I actually started at Apple in April '68, James Taylor was already there. He was in the office with Paul and Peter Asher."

56:46 Paul: "Mary Hopkin was the main thing, y'know, I didn't really bring her, but she was on a talent show."

56:52 Neil Aspinall: "Mary Hopkins _[sic]_ came from the Huey Green, y'know, whatever his show was called."

56:58 Paul: "Opportunity Knocks."

57:00 Neil Aspinall: "I think Mal Evans found Badfinger, **right, who were called the Ivy's at the time.**"

57:05 Ringo: "Badfinger, I thought, came through Paul."

57:09 George: "And I produced Doris Troy, and I produced a record by Jackie Lomax."

57:14 _Sour Milk Sea_ by Jackie Lomax (subsequent Apple artist clips are disconnected from the above interview context.)

57:31 _Something in the Way She Moves_ by James Taylor

57:53 _Maybe Tomorrow_ by The Iveys, who became Badfinger

58:16 _No Matter What_ by Badfinger

58:32 _Goodbye_ by Mary Hopkin

58:54 Paul: "Anyone who wanted to show up and produce as much as he wanted to produce was welcome too. But people didn't do the same amount of work. I think I lived in London, I was there more. So I probably did a little bit more production, for instance, than Ringo did. I'm not sure what Ringo did actually."

59:13 Ringo: "I wasn't as involved as the others. As I say, y'know, it was fun. We'd go in and, y'know, a lot of what it did related to the four of us."

59:24 Paul: "As I say, John wanted to do stuff like Zapple. He wanted a sort of funky label that he could do crazy stuff on. So that became his area, which was quite nice."

59:34 Neil Aspinall: "It might have been exciting for everybody else, and for people that came in from the outside. For me, it was a lot of hard work setting it up and a lot of chaos."

59:46 George: "I was still in India when it started. I think it was basically John and Paul's madness, ego, running away with themselves or with each other."

59:58 Paul (Apple launch): "It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment..." up to "They'll go to help people, but not like a charity."

01:00:15 Paul: "We were just guys goofing off, having a lot of fun, trying to get things under our control," up to George: "The only thing we could do was write songs and make records and be Beatles, **successfully**."

01:00:46 _Lady Madonna_, complete song, promo film that used footage of the _Hey Bulldog_ session.

01:02:56 Opening of _Yellow Submarine_ movie up to Paul: "I think seeing it now is pretty good. Y'know, it's quite interesting really."

01:04:30 George: "Yeah, I like the film, I think it's a classic film," up to "I think it suits it."

01:04:52 Paul: (exaggerated Scouse accent) "But that's where all of that stuff came from, y'know, that sort of terrible fake Liverpool accent, hello."

01:04:59 Clip: "Yes deh do look very nice, don't dey?"

01:05:13 Ringo: "The thing with that film that still blows me away is that..." up to John: "So then I decided to see the rest of the show and that's when we met."

01:08:49 John: "The naked album cover **was less, general than that, meaning they didn't, have we didn't have,** that was the one of the first things we did."

01:09:00 John: "**We thought, y'know,** we felt like two virgins, that's what the album was called, because we were in love, just met and we were trying to make something."

01:09:08 Ringo: "They showed me this cover..." up to "Well, Ring, you only have to answer the phone, so okay, fine."

1:09:42 George: "They were, from that point on, never to be seen without each other, y'know, for the next few years, at least."

01:09:50 Paul: "Trouble was, for us, it encroached on our framework..." up to Ringo: "And that's how they started to live, every moment together."

01:10:39 John: "Everybody seemed to be paranoid except for us..." up to: "We just happened to be, want to be together all the time."

01:11:17 _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, acoustic demo, over end credits.

EP8 00:28 **The 'White Album' sequence, presented at [the start of Episode 8](#8&dvd0) in the DVD version, has been both modified and moved to the end of Episode 7 for Disney+. It is included here for comparison.** George: "Suddenly one day, I think Neil or somebody said, 'Oh, Ringo's gone on holiday.'"

EP8 00:35 Ringo: "I felt two things, I felt I wasn't playing great..." up to "I thought it was you three."

EP8 01:28 Paul: "**So we had to kind of reassure him that we did think he was great.** I mean, y'know, that's what he's like in life," up to "I think he was pleased to hear that."

EP8 01:59 Ringo: "**Y'know,** and I knew we were just in a messed up stage, all of us then, y'know, it wasn't just me, it was, the whole thing was going down."

EP8 02:08 Ringo: "And I came back and went in the studio and George had had decked out with flowers..." up to "and we'd got through that little crisis."

EP8 02:30 Ringo: "**And it was great. And then the White Album really took off and like Yer Blues, y'know, the track Yer Blues was great. We all left the studio and went to a little room so there's no separation.** And there was lots of group activity going down. I loved the White Album."

EP8 02:47 George: "There was a lot more individual stuff for the first time..." up to "... maybe they'd set a release date and time was running out."

EP8 03:14 _Blackbird_, Paul in Studio 2, watched by Francie Schwartz.

EP8 03:34 _What's the New, Mary Jane?_, _Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da_ and _Good Night_, _Rocky Racoon_, _Sexy Sadie_, _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, _Mother Nature's Son_, _Piggies_, _I Will_, _Julia_, _Why Don't We Do It in the Road?_, _I'm So Tired_, _Don't Pass Me By_, including early takes and studio chatter.

EP8 07:21 George Martin: "**A lot of the recordings where they would have a basic idea, and then they would have a jam session to end it, which sometimes didn't sound too good, but y'know, this was fairly small criticism.** When they did the White Album, I thought we should have made probably a very very good single album out of it rather than making a double album."

EP8 08:06 Ringo: "Well, no, I agree, we should have put it out as two separate albums, the White and the Whiter Album..." up to George: "... elbowed or made into b-sides."

EP8 08:38 George Martin: "I think it was an album which could have been made a fantastically good album if it had been compressed a bit condensed, but a lot of people I know think it's still the best album they made, so it's not my view, but horses for courses."

EP8 08:51 Paul: "**Well you can always say that, y'know, I say it's, perhaps, I'll go with, but not definitely. I mean, in fact,** I think it's a fine little album..." up to "... it's the bloody Beatles' White Album, shut up!"

EP8 09:23 _Revolution_ promo film, complete song but with John's complaint below part-way through.

EP8 10:58 John: "There was a little trauma with a song called revolution. I thought it was _au courant_, as they say, and it was about what was going on at the time, and I wanted to put it out as a single, y'know. I said, let's put this in, we should say something about it and this is what I want to say, y'know, and they said no, it's too slow."
