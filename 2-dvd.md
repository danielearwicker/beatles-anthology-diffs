Anthology, 2003 DVD Version: Episode 2

00:44 Paul: "Probably the thing that John and I will do, will be write songs, as we have been doing, as a sort of sideline now. We'll probably develop that a bit more."

00:55 Ringo: "When we go home, we go in early in the morning, when we've finished the job, and the kids, y'know, they don't know you're at home. But if they find out, well, where I live, they get the drums out, and beat it out... It was getting really big, I think we noticed as we tried to move around town, we started, y'know, being noticed in the street."

01:23 Paul: "One of the things I was grateful for was, we had a kind of staircase to climb."

01:28 John: "First of all it was making it big in Liverpool, and being the best group in the county, y'know, then being the best group in England, and then we go up to Scotland and break them in, and things like that."

01:37 Paul: "Then it was like, well, what's left? Well, radio..." up to Saturday Club, John "Greeting everybody with a smile" and Brian Matthew, "Thank you, dear Beatles". at 04:00.

04:01 John: "And your goal was always, y'know, just a few yards ahead, rather than right up there"

04:05 Neil Aspinall: "When we used to tour, do those Arthur Howe touring shows..." up to George: "actually closing the first half of the show."

05:23 _Thank You Girl_ (tour photo montage)

05:38 George Martin: "**Let's go back a bit, you remember, the very first record issued was _Love Me Do_, second record was _Please Please Me_, which was only arrived at after much doubt on my part that they could ever write a hit song. From that moment onward, they blossomed and become wonderful songwriters.** But before they showed evidence of that, I still had to have an album out. And so what I did was, I mean, I'd been up to the Cavern and I'd seen what they could do, I knew their repertoire, I knew what they were able to perform, _[cut still photos, GM continues in VO]_ and I said 'Let's record every song you've got. Come down to the studio and we'll just whistle through them in a day.'"

06:15 Montage of snippets from finished LP over contemporary photos/footage

06:42 Ringo: "But we knew those songs, you see, because that was the act we did all over the country."

06:46 More montage of snippets from finished LP

07:30 George: "Basically this album is what we did live, y'know, in the clubs, so I think we just kept running through so, what about this, what about this, how does that go, we'd play a bit, then say what else have you got?"

07:45 More montage

08:10 Paul: "And 10:30 that evening John finally, about 10 o'clock, he sang _Twist and Shout_ cos his voice was going all day, and he knew he could only give it one or two goes and it would just rip it, which it did and you can hear it on the record, it was pretty cool."

08:25 John: "I couldn't sing a damn thing I was just screaming"

22:31 John: "We were the first working-class singers, that stayed working-class, and pronounced it, didn't try and change our accents, which in England are looked - were looked down upon, probably still are."

22:44 Cathy of the Cavern: "They Beatlees, they are Liverpudlians, and they belong to us, they belong to the Cavern. And yes, let the rest of the country have them, let them enjoy them, but please, let them come back to us, at least once, just to be the same as they used to be, with no changes at all. It'd be fantastic."

23:05 Ringo: "It was impossible to go home. And also, it's very true, if you're in our business, you go to London,.." up to John's "We were very close to the Stones." at 24:11.

24:13 John: "This song we're gonna play, _I Wanna Be Your Man_, which we virtually finished off in front of them, because they needed a record, they'd put out _Come On_ by Chuck Berry and they needed a quick follow-up."

24:36 George: "We were always kinda, y'know, a little nervous, before each step we went up the ladder. We were a little nervous but we always had that confidence."

26:43 George: "And that was the good thing about being four together, not like Elvis, which, y'know, I always felt sorry later for Elvis 'cause he was on his own, he had his guys with him, but, there was only one Elvis, nobody else knew what he felt like, but for us we all shared the experience."

37:17 Ringo: "When I was playing in the living room, with Eddie Clayton, one of my mother's great friends, Annie McGuire was so great, she'd say 'See you on the Palladium son, see yer name in lights!' That was the place to get to, God, the London Palladium, then you'd made it. Nothing bigger, actually, in the world, than making it to the Palladium. And I said 'Sure, Annie, that's where we're gonna go,' so it was one of my things, get to the Palladium, that was as far as I was looking. And I was sick! 'Here they are' and I spewed up and went on. Just nervous, craziness, tension... And we played the gig, we got on that roundabout, it was dynamite, this was it! Y'know what I mean? 'Cause anyone who knew you, yourself, fuckin' hell, eh, well, look at this! It's just pretty far out, the Palladium."

54:58 John: "In the early days we were really set on giving people their money's worth, and that was our policy at first, to put 14 tracks aside that was brand new and never put singles on the album, which everybody did was have a hit single and make an album round it."

55:15 George Martin: "_With the Beatles_ was the first, kind of put-together album of, first songbook, so to speak. And they gave me a list of their songs and they were all thinking in terms of singls still."

55:30 George Martin (still on camera): "We weren't thinking of an album being an entity by itself. It was a collection of their songs, and I think one or two other people's songs as well."

55:41 George Martin: "And all we did was to record singles, and the ones that weren't too good, we wouldn't issue as singles, we'd put them on an album, **which is what _With The Beatles_ was**."

55:49 _Please Mister Postman_ (lip sync, whole track)

59:31 Brian Matthew reports on _With The Beatles_ breaking advance sales records

59:55 Paul: "I think one of the cheekiest things we ever did was to say to Brian Epstein we're not going to America till we've got a number one. And the reason we did that, we'd seen a lot of people like, Adam Faith, Cliff Richard, British stars, quite big stars over in Britain, go over to America and be like, third or fourth on the bill to people like Frankie Avalon, **who we didn't really respect, or Fabian, people like that, who were a little bit sort of one-hit-wonders to us, so we thought that's the kiss of death, is to go over to America, and y'know, come down in your career, really, and take a downward step, and we didn't want to do that, so for some reason we just said to Brian, right, we're not going to America till we've got a number one record.**"

1:00:37 George Martin: "**We were trying to get into America all the time. I really thought _She Loves You_ would have broken the American... but if you think of our frustration here, we were being turned down by the company which EMI actually owned. And I was very frustrated by this, and I said if they're not going to let us, if they're not going to put it out, in the case of _From Me to You_ was the first one which we offered them, we'll, they can't deny us other people putting them out**. So I would then take the record back from them and try and get it out with another label. And I did negotiations with Swan and with Vee-Jay, each of whom, just very tiny labels in the States, took one or the other titles, and they put those records out in America, and of course being small labels they didn't make a great deal of, um, success."

1:01:29 Paul: "And that was the way it worked out. We released _Please Please Me_ - flop. _From Me To You_ - flop. Changed record labels. Released _She Loves You_, they'd all been big hits in England, all been number one - all of them flops, nothing."

1:01:43 George Martin: "By this time the news from England and Europe was overwhelming that they were a hit group. **So they had to take them more seriously than before**. And also, the Swan and Vee-Jay labels were making inroads, they were selling by this time. So Capitol were forced to release _I Wanna Hold Your Hand_."

1:02:01 George Martin: "**It** wasn't designed specifically for the American market, but like the ones before it, it was a great record."

1:02:07 _I Want to Hold Your Hand_ (lip sync, whole track)

1:04:32 Paul: "The funny thing about France is it was boys screaming. **And I think the girls were under heavy chaperone, because** it was boys. So we got 'Le Beatle! Le Beatle' (speaks in mock French) 'Paul! John!' It was like, 'Oui, yeah, okay', y'know, like, dear me. **Funny crowd. But um, so we went down kind of medium. We were on a bill with Trini Lopez. If he had a hammer, you remember?**"

1:05:04 Ringo: "I didn't know Trini was on that show. I thought it was Sylvie Vartan and a few other people. It was very strange because, uh, suddenly we had, as you said, all these boys, and they were chasing us all over Paris, and we'd been so used to the girls, y'know."

1:05:18 George: "We had visions of all these French girls, y'know, "ooh la la" and all that, and instead, the audience, at least on the opening night, **was all tuxedoed elderly French people, and hanging round the stage door** all seemed to be **a bunch of slightly gay-looking** boys shouting 'Ringo! Ringo!'"

1:05:39 Paul: "I don't think we went down that well, but I think we built it over the few days, we kind of built it up, and eventually it was a bit of a success, y'know. But it wasn't quite what we were used to, we were used to a little bit more instant success than that."

1:06:02 Paul: "We got a telegram in the evening..." up to "Tell the boys there's a big crowd waiting for them there" at 1:09:18.

1:09:18 John: "We never expected anybody, didn't expect to sell records or anything over here, we're just amazed."
