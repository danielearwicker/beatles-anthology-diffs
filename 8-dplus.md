00:34 David Frost: "It's my pleasure to introduce now in their first live appearance for goodness knows how long in front of an audience, The Beatles."

00:42 _Hey Jude_ on David Frost, first verse before voice-over begins.

01:40 Paul: "I was driving out to John's house after John and Cynthia had got divorced..." up to "... sometimes get a little emotional during that moment, y'know?"

03:22 _Hey Jude_ continues for about 25 seconds before another voice-over.

03:47 George Martin: "Hey, June was a long one and I timed it and I said, 'Y'know, this is going on for seven minutes. You can't make a single that's seven minutes long.' And John said, 'Why not?' I couldn't think of a good answer, really, except that the pathetic one, 'Well, disc jockeys won't play it.' He said, 'They will if it's us.' And, of course, he was absolutely right."

04:03 Paul: "We had this sort of chanty thing at the end. I remember going and taking it down to club when it was first, taking an acetate of it down to club a real late night, sort of 3 in the morning, sort of dossing round on bean bags type club. And I met Mick Jagger down there and I said, 'Yeah, I've brought this round. I'm going to put it on, you've, get the DJ to put it on.' I remember Mick coming up to me, he says, 'It's like two songs, man.' He goes, 'It is, it's got the song and then that whole nah-nah-nah-nah at the end.' Yeah, and it was longer than any single had been. We had a good bunch of engineers and we'd say, 'How long can a 45 be?' They'd say, 'Well, it was really supposed to be like, y'know, four minutes. It's about all you can squeeze in those grooves before it seriously starts to lose volume.' And y'know, everyone's got to turn up. But they did some very clever stuff, some clever work sort of squeezing this bit that didn't have to be loud and then allowing this bit in. Somehow they got seven minutes on there, which was quite an engineering feat.

05:18 George Martin: "They were going through a very revolutionary period at that time..." up to "And we started rehearsing down in Twickenham Film Studios and I went along with them."

05:50 George: "I think the original idea was Paul's idea to rehearse some new songs, and then we were going to pick a location and record the album of the songs in a concert. I suppose kind of like how they do these days on unplugged except, y'know, it wasn't to be unplugged, just to do a live album."

06:16 Paul: "The original idea was that you'd see the Beatles rehearsing, jamming" up to "Michael Lindsay-Hogg was going to direct it."

06:38 Same clip from Twickenham, not noticeably restored, still cropped to 4:3, but with a number of new cuts to different camera angles and reaction shots.

07:31 George: "The idea was just to, y'know, learn the tunes and play 'em, and so that we'd be able to record them without loads of overdubs."

08:02 George: "I thought, okay, y'know, well, it's a new year, and we've got a new approach, but it soon became apparent that it wasn't anything new. It was just going to be painful again."

08:20 Ringo: "I mean, y'know, the days were long and it could get boring, y'know, and Twickenham just wasn't really conducive to any great atmosphere, it was just in a big barn."

08:31 John: "It was just dreadful, dreadful feeling and being filmed all the time" up to George: "I'm not able to be happy in this situation, y'know, I'm getting out of here."

10:41 George: "I'd just spent like the last six months producing an album of this fellow Jackie Lomax and hanging out with Bob Dylan and the band in Woodstock and having a great time and for me to come back into the winter of discontent with the Beatles in Twickenham was, it was very unhealthy and unhappy."

11:04 Ringo: "So George decided to leave, but he didn't tell John or I, or Paul. We all went for lunch. And we were looking for George and he'd gone. He'd gone home. But the interesting part about that, I mean, besides what him and Paul were into, is that when we came back, we just started jamming and Yoko jumped in."

11:26 Twickenham jam session with John, Paul, Yoko and Ringo.

11:33 Ringo: "We really played sort of violently. Paul was doing his bass stuff into the amp, and John was off. I was playing sort of this weird drum stuff that I don't play like that as a rule. So our reaction, I think, was really interesting at the time."

11:55 Clip from Twickenham where Paul discusses his idea for a sensationalist news program that would conclude by announcing the break-up of the Beatles. This appears in a different form in part 2 of _Get Back (2021)_ at around 09:00. Here it is cropped to 4:3, and stays on Ringo's astonished expression much longer, and includes further reactions from Linda and Michael, which Paul acknowledges: "Thanks, but no thanks."

12:42 George: "I mean it's kind of important to state, I suppose, that a lot of water went under the bridge and that at this point in time, as we talk now, everybody's good friends and has a better understanding of the past, but talking just about what was happening at that time, it was, like, strange."

13:04 John: "The whole pressure of it finally got to us" up to Ringo: "... there was many discussions going on by then, many heated discussions." **This includes a performance of _For You Blue_ which has been re-cut to include shots of the rest of group instead of one long shot of George.**

17:22 Discussion at the Apple studio from Day 16 (25th Jan) about what kind of finale Paul is now hoping for. The same discussion appears toward the end of part 2 of _Get Back (2021)_, but here it is 4:3 and uses mostly different camera angles.

18:08 George: "It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don't really want everybody to know that they're so bitchy, and this happened back in the White album when I brought Eric Clapton in to play on _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, suddenly everybody's on their best behaviour. **I went also with Eric Clapton to see Ray Charles play at the festival hall. And I saw this guy who was on stage playing the organ and dancing across the stage, and, before Ray Charles came on. I thought, 'God, that guy looks familiar.' And it turned out it was Billy Preston.** So I put a message out to find if Billy was in town and told him to come in to Savile Row, which he did. Straight away, just became 100% improvement in the vibe in the room. **[edit]**"

19:01 George Martin: "Billy Preston was a great help, he was a very good keyboard guy. **[edit]** He was an amiable fellow too, very nice and he was a kind of, yes he was a kind of emollient if you like, he helped to lubricate the friction that had been there."

19:14 Clip of John explaining to Billy that they're working without overdubs, dialogue is far clearer, cuts between multiple camera angles.

19:22 Paul: "We did have to behave ourselves a bit because he was sort of like a guest in the house. But I think it was a slight worry in the background also that maybe he was joining the group. You couldn't tell whether it was a crack in the whole thing. It's just a little bit puzzling, I think, y'know. But he played great and we all had a great time playing with him."

19:48 Group discussion about where to put the guitar solo in _Get Back_, excellent sound restoration.

20:38 Ringo: "**[edit]** Suddenly, when we were working on something good, the bullshit went out the window and we got back down to doing what we did really, really well."

20:48 Paul: "To me, the Beatles were always a great little band," up to "... it seemed to work, it seemed to gel."

21:21 _One After 909_, brief excerpt, followed by a montage of crazy high jinks from the Apple sessions.

21:30 Paul: "One after 909, it was our childhood coming back to us. It was sort of raw energy from our youth, and I think it reminded us of those teenage years, and so it surfaced, as did Maggie Mae, and a few things like that. During the Let It Be sessions, we were just dredging up anything."

21:51 _Maggie Mae_

22:13 Paul: "They were quite good sessions. Once we got into Apple, I remember, y'know, sitting around quite enjoying the music. It was quite interesting music to play."

22:20 _The Long and Winding Road_, starting from the instrumental break, up to the end.

00:23 George: "The idea being that we were going to, originally we were going to rehearse all these new songs..." up to Paul: "And we said, 'Well, that's an end, 'Beatle's busted on rooftop gig.'" Includes roof-top performance of _Don't Let Me Down_, which is shot-for-shot identical to the DVD version, the only difference being the colour correction that makes the sky appear realistically London-white instead of Neptune-blue, and the picture restoration.

29:13 _Get Back_, roof-top performance. Mostly follows the DVD version's structure, but more obviously a reconstruction, with cuts in slightly different places and many alternate shots.

31:02 Ringo: "The thing on the roof that always I feel let down about with the police," up to "So it could have been fabulous."

31:46 John hopes they passed the audition.

31:51 _Let It Be_, preceded by the "Are we supposed to giddle in the solo?" dialogue as heard on _Anthology 3_, truncated by commentary.

34:24 John: "By the time we got to Let It Be, we couldn't play the game any more, we couldn't do it any more. It had come to a point where it was no longer creating magic, and the camera sort of, being in the room with us made us aware of that, that it was a phony situation."

34:37 Paul: "In fact, what happened was when we got in there, we showed how the break-up of a group works. We didn't realise that we were actually sort of breaking up, y'know, as it was happening."

34:48 George: "Y'know, it was quite obvious that the Beatles became, y'know, I mean, the thing that it started out being, it gave us a vehicle to be able to do so much when we were younger and then we grew right through that. But it got to a point where it was stifling us, there was too much restriction, y'know, it had to self-destruct."

35:10 Ringo: "**[edit]** But the energy for The Beatles was waning, y'know, we put in a thousand percent and then it was dwindling now. It's like, oh dear, do we have to turn up? We have to do that thing again? I want to do this and John wants to do that. And, y'know, George was off and, y'know, people would, y'know, we had families."

35:31 John: "There were times when I spent as much time with George, Paul and Ringo as I did with Yoko, I mean I slept with them in the same room on tour and I lived, ate and breathed with them for five or ten years."

35:42 George Martin: "The Beatles were bigger than any one of them, so they were always prisoners of that. And I think they just eventually got fed up with it."

36:03 Paul: "And I remember thinking of it like army buddies..." up to "We always knew that day had to come."

36:25 Bob Danvers-Walker for [Pathe News](https://www.britishpathe.com/asset/89312/) on Paul and Linda's "plans for a quiet wedding."

36:56 George Martin: "They wanted to live a life like you and I do, where your wife is more important than your partner. It wasn't in those days. But as Yoko came along and as eventually Linda came along, so that they were more important to John and Paul than John and Paul were to each other. And the same went for the other boys too. They wanted the freedom of living a real life."

37:20 John: "It takes a lot to live with four people, over and over for years and years, which is what we did. And we'd call each other every name under the sun. We'd got to blows,we'd been through the whole damn show."

37:32 _The Ballad of John and Yoko_ over footage of their trip to get married.

37:43 John: "We wanted to get married on the cross-channel ferry..." up to "... and we went there and it was beautiful."

38:07 _The Ballad of John and Yoko_ fades back up on the line that mentions Peter Brown, edited to skip to the end after less than a minute.

39:02 John: "It's easy after the fact, y'know, people were saying about Apple and the Beatles' business..." up to Neil Aspinall: "... Alan Klein had the opportunity to come in and say he could do it, but so did a lot of other people."

40:14 Paul: "He engineered a meeting via Derek Taylor, who was our publicist. Apparently he got hold of Derek and said I want to meet the Beatles, y'know. I think Derek got him to meet John and Yoko

40:23 Alistair Taylor: "Within a couple of days, John came bounding into Apple, 'Right, OK, I don't care about the rest of you, I'm giving Klein everything. He's got me and he's got Yoko and that's it.' And it was more or less all go from there."

40:37 George: "Klein had been managing the Rolling Stones, and I believe Donovan..." up to John: "I make a lot of mistakes character-wise, y'know? But now then, I make a good one, y'know?"

41:09 Paul: "So John arrived, said OK, that's it, I'm going with Klein. George and Ringo said OK, well we're going with John, and I realised I was sort of expected to just sort of go along with it, but I didn't think it was a good idea."

41:23 Paul: "I'd put forward Lee Eastman, Linda's dad, as possible sort of lawyer..." up to "... so the three to one thing was very awkward."

42:03,520 Neil Aspinall: "What changed at Apple after he arrived, everything. It was a completely different situation. Number one, right, first and foremost, Paul wasn't there."

42:15 John: "Because there was a lot of tension around the Alan Klein coming in days and all that and we had to be together all the time, fighting and arguing and listening to all these different business things."

42:27 Ringo: "Y'know, in a lot of days, even with all the craziness, it really worked still. Instead of working every day, it worked like two days a month, y'know. There were still good days. We were still really close friends, y'know. Then it would split off again into some madness."

42:46 Paul: "And we were enough friends, y'know, that even though this undercurrent was going on, even at the very worst points, y'know, I think we still had some sort of respect for each other, but it got, it was getting fairly dodgy."

42:58 George Martin: "**[edit]** Let It Be was such an unhappy record really, even though there were some great songs on it, I really thought that was the end of the Beatles and I thought I would never work with them again. I thought what a shame to go out there like this."

43:08 George: "Well I think the deal was that, y'know, through Let It Be it was like, we, I left, and we got back on the basis that we've got to just finish it up, make it tidy. So I got back on that basis, then everybody decided, well, we ought to do one better album."

43:26 George Martin: "So I was quite surprised when Paul rang me up..." up to "... and let's get together again. **[edit]**"

43:48 Paul: "I think before the Abbey Road sessions it was like we should put down the boxing gloves And try and just get it together and really make a very special album

43:58 _Because_ fades up, before cutting to a count-in from John to introduce a snippet of _Come Togther_, over stills from the cover shoot, and then into the _Something_ promo film, but with the soundtrack initially staying on _Come Together_.

44:18 Paul: "You tended to think well if there's going to be a single it would be John or me Or John or me that would write it, And then suddenly George just came up with this song y'know something in the way she moves."

44:48 John: (studio chatter) "Stop it you disgusting middle-aged squares!"

44:52 _Here Comes the Sun_ over studio photos

45:20 _Octopus's Garden_

45:28 Ringo: "**[edit]** It doesn't matter what we're going through as individuals, y'know, on the bullshit level. When it gets to the music, y'know, when you can see that it's really cool, we all put in the 1,000%. The last section of Abbey Road Which is, y'know, I still think is for me one of the finest pieces we've put together. And y'know it's like out of the ashes of all that madness, this really great piece came together."

45:52 _Mean Mr. Mustard_

46:01 Paul: "We had lots and lots of bits of things. John had a bit of a song called _Polythene Pam_."

46:08 Studio chatter, _Polythene Pam_

46:14 Paul: "And we hit upon the idea of meddling them all, which gave the second side of Abbey Road a kind of sort of operatic kind of structure, which was quite nice because it got rid of all these songs in a good way."

46:36 _You're Gonna Carry That Weight_

46:47 George: "We didn't know, or I didn't know at the time, that it was the last Beatle record that we would make. It kind of felt a bit like we were reaching the end of the line."

46:59 Paul: "I think it was, in a way, the feeling that it might be our last. So let's just show 'em what we can do. Let's show each other what we can do, and let's try and have a good time doing it.

47:08 George Martin: "**[edit]** It was a very, very happy album. Everybody worked frightfully well and that's why I'm very fond of it."

47:14 _Golden Slumbers_

47:44 George: "But I think at the point we'd finished Abbey Road, it was really the game was up, y'know, and I think we all accepted that."

47:50 Ringo: "It was magical. Some really loving, caring moments between four people. **[edit]** A really amazing closeness. There were four guys who really loved each other. It was pretty sensational."

48:22 George: "Y'know, they gave their money and they gave their screams..." up to Paul: "There's a very good spirit behind it all."

48:59 John: "I've read cracks about the Beatles saying, "All you need is love," but it didn't work for them, y'know. But nothing will ever break the love we have for each other."

49:09 _The End_

59:46 Compilation of studio out-takes over closing credits
