Anthology, 2025 Disney+ Version: Episode 3

00:36 John: "We were like in the eye of the hurricane, so we were just in this little goldfish bowl in the middle of it. One didn't really have time to think what was going on, it was just going on so fast."

00:46 George: "**[edit]** Ed Sullivan had seen us in England and all the time and life and news week had all put covers of The Beatles on their magazines prior to us arriving, so it was a surprise though, 'cause we thought we'd have to work a little bit for this notoriety."

01:02 John: "When we arrived here, we knew how to handle press, the British press, are the toughest in the world, we could handle anything. We were all right."

01:13 Ringo: "The press, they started shouting at us. They liked being just shouted back at, y'know, and we did do it with humour."

01:20 Press Conference, US. Greatly enhanced sound of questions from reporters.

01:36 John: "Oh, we're all bald. **[edit]**"

02:01 George: "Everybody in Liverpool thinks they're a comedian. And when you just transposed it into New York or somewhere, it was, it was great. I mean, we were just being hard-faced, really, and they loved it."

02:15 Paul: "I remember, for instance, the great moment of going into the limo and putting on the radio, and there we were on American radio," up to the arrival at the hotel.

04:17 Ringo: "We had this huge suite of rooms in the Plaza Hotel. And we had radios with earpieces so we could phone in, Murray the K, and we could listen to him talking on the radio. This was all so fascinating to me. It was just too far out."

04:33 John: "We were so overawed by American radio..." up to the end of _All My Loving_ on the Ed Sullivan show.

11:36 George: "Later they said there was the least reported, or there was no reported crime. Even the criminals had a rest for like 10 minutes while we were on."

11:51 Ed Sullivan on the Elvis telegram

12:04 Ringo: "And then we did the train ride to Washington."

12:57 News reporter: "There may be a controversy over the Beatles' apparel and their hairdos, but there's no debate about one thing, they sure have got talent."

13:05 Ringo: "The Washington gig, there was like 10,000, 12,000 people. That was a hell of a lot of people in those days that you were playing to."

14:01 _She Loves You_ Live at Washington Coliseum

16:02 Neil Aspinall: "We did that Washington show. It was like a boxing ring, right, with people all round. Every song, you'd go to a different side of the stage, right, and so you'd have to move the mics all the time, y'know? And Ringo was sitting on a, like this round thing in the middle of the stage, that his drums were on so he had to turn that round to face whichever way the band were playing, and the bloody thing got stuck.

16:28 John: (shouting to be heard from the stage) "He's gotta turn his drums round!"

16:36 Neil Aspinall: "Y'know, so there's all this chaos going on and whatever. But it was a good show."

16:49 _I Saw Her Standing There_ Live at Washington Coliseum

19:18 Ringo: "We were surrounded by the kids, and with it being America, the parents sort of went along with the kids more than they did in England. I loved it. I absolutely loved it."

19:32 John: "We didn't think if, whether we were that good or not. You've got to think you're good to do what we did, y'know. Last thing I remember is playing music in a club and the next minute, this. But we never thought about it too much, because it was an ongoing thing, it was happening to us, and it was hard to see, y'know, we were just in the middle being ushered from room to room."

19:50 Paul: "Yeah, the British Embassy, it was, there was a kind of party, y'know, so this was one of the things..." up to John storming after Ringo's unwanted haircut.

20:59 _I'll Follow the Sun_ (over Miami holiday photos)

21:05 Paul: (VO) "And then we eventually, as you say, got down to Miami, which was, well, I mean, that was just like paradise. 'Cause we'd never been to anywhere where there was, like, palm trees. And we took a lot of photos, y'know, we were like tourists and we had our Pentax cameras."

22:01 Ringo: "This was just the most brilliant place I'd ever been to, and people were lending us yachts or anything we wanted. I mean, this family lent us their boat, and they let me drive a 60-foot yacht. Y'know, a speedboat, which I proceeded to bring in to port, head-on, not really knowing much about driving speedboats. And so y'know they have those pretty rails on the front hanging out, well this was... and just bent the bugger all over the place. But they didn't seem to mind, they were just happy."

22:37 Paul: "We had a great time there, we stayed in a hotel most of the time and sort of looked down on the sand where the kids, the fans would write I LOVE JOHN on the sand, y'know, so you could read it from your hotel room. I remember playing at one of the hotels, and they always have cabarets."

23:00 Ed Sullivan introduces the second Beatles show, up to the interview back in London ending with George saying "What money?"

28:16 _A Hard Day's Night_ movie opening titles clip

28:17 Paul: "We'd always, y'know, I'm talking about this progression with the Beatles from, y'know, little Stevedores and Dockers Union" up to where Spike Milligan walks slowly to the camera and is then punched in the face, and Paul continues talking about Richard Lester.

30:27 Paul: "... And he got hold of Alan Owen, who was a Welsh playwright. **[edit]** And so he was a very likeable Welsh bloke, and he came and he hung out with us for a few days..." up to the end of _If I Fell_ from the film.

35:23 George Martin: "They didn't really get totally immersed in record production until later on when they stopped touring. There wasn't time. They would dash into the studio, put down their tracks and they'd leave all the work really to us. I mean, they were incredibly busy during those first years.

35:37 _I'm Happy Just to Dance with You_

35:45 George: "If you look at our itinerary, some of those years where we did maybe a tour of England, a tour of Europe, a tour of America, two albums of our four EPs and three singles and we made a movie all in the same year. Jesus, how did we do that?"

36:04 Studio outtakes, leading to released version of _I'll Be Back_ over morphing pictures from the album cover.

36:21 Brian Matthew: "The next few minutes are in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles..." Interview about making film.

37:15 Ringo: "I found it exciting. I loved it."

37:18 John: "**[edit]** Because there was a lot of comedy in it, people were saying, 'Oh, y'know, they're the young Marx brothers.' I think there's nothing else, there'd never been a group of four people, I suppose, doing comedy besides them."

37:27 George: "But I think that was part of the thing, that the Beatles were very funny. I mean, they actually were funny."

37:34 John: "All of us like the bit in the field, we all jump about like lunatics, because that's pure film, as the director told us. Y'know, it's just pure filming, and we could have been anybody, but we enjoy that."

37:59 _Can't Buy Me Love_ continues, up to John reading _The Wrestling Dog_ on _Not Only But Also_.

40:42 Dudley Moore: "Mr. John Lennon... **[edit]**"

40:42 John interviewed about how long he'd been writing, and is dismissive of the interviewer's attempts at wordplay.

41:16 Scenes of Brian Epstein as his assistant explains how to pronounce his name, up to George: "Remember we played in Amsterdam was when Derek first became, like, on tour with us."

42:26 Derek Taylor: "It was all very exciting and wonderful but I think only a madman would have volunteered to join such a thing."

42:33 _Long Tall Sally_ live in the Netherlands, Jimmie Nicol already on the drums.

42:50 George Martin: "We nearly didn't do that tour."

42:52 Ringo: "Yes, I was desperately ill, I was having my tonsils out."

42:58 George Martin: "George is very loyal person and he said if Ringo is not part of the group It's not Beatles, said I don't see we should do it. I'm not gonna go."

43:07 Ringo: "What a guy. I never knew that."

43:09 George: "**How many Beatles does it take to change a light bulb, see? Four.** And, yeah, I really despise the way we couldn't ever make a decision for ourselves..."

43:30 Jimmie drumming as the three healthy Beatles surround him

43:45 Ringo: "It was very strange, and, y'know, because I was it wasn't well and they'd taken Jimmie Nicols [sic] and I thought they didn't love me anymore, and all that stuff went through my head."

43:54 _Long Tall Sally_ with Jimmie Nicol up to _You Can't Do That_ live in Australia with Ringo (this sequence trims off Paul introducing _All My Loving_ and drops a whole verse/chorus of _You Can't Do That_ but otherwise retains all commentary.)

54:42 Ringo: "Even though we felt, yes, we're established and we've conquered all these countries and we're selling a lot of records and they all love us, y'know, I don't think we... I didn't feel like it's still gonna go on forever."

54:57 _A Hard Day's Night_ over footage of premieres in London and then Liverpool

55:03 John: "And when you first see yourself on a big screen, you just watch yourself..." up to "... we went back and it was one of the best ever."
