00:26 **The Philippines sequence that starts this episode in the DVDs has been edited down and moved to the end of episode 5 in the Disney+ version. The surviving elements are sequenced identically. The elements below are only in the DVD version.**

03:05 Ringo: "John and I were sharing the room after the gig, and then we woke up in the morning. And we phoned down for breakfast on the newspapers, because we always like to read about ourselves. I thought, 'Yeah, can we have, y'know, egg and bacon?' Whatever we were eating in those days. And the newspapers, all the newspapers, y'know. We were just hanging out in our beds, chatting, y'know. Doing whatever we were doing, and so time went by, so we called down again. 'Excuse me, y'know, can we have some breakfast?' Blah-de-blah. And still nothing happened..."

05:38 John: "But I thought, I was petrified. I could have been kicked and not known it. I just know I was getting booed."

05:43 Ringo: "Y'know, this was the famous story of John and I hiding behind these nuns. Because we thought, it's a Catholic country, they won't beat up the nuns."

05:51 Paul: "And then we got on the plane, which was the British Airways, were all kissing the seats and everything. Y'know, this is Britain, little piece of Britain. It was feeling like that, y'know, you were definitely in a foreign country, where all the rules had changed. They did carry guns, after all, so, y'know, you weren't too gung-ho about it all.

06:10 George: "And then one of our guys' announcement came over. They were saying, "Well, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Evans and Mr. Barrow." That was Tony Barrow, I believe. He was our press agent at the time. "Will they get off the plane?" And Mal, who was the nicest, gentlest person, was a big guy, but he was really sweet. He went past me down the aisle of the plane to get off. And he was breaking out in tears, and he turned to me and he said, "Tell Lil I love her." That's his wife, because he thought that was it, y'know. I mean, the plane was going to go, and he was going to be stuck in Manila. And anyway, we sat there again for what seemed like a couple of hours. It was probably 30 minutes, maybe an hour. And they got back on the plane, and then the plane was allowed to leave. Apparently they took the money off Brian Epstein that we'd earned at the concert."

07:29 John: (group interview footage) "We'll just never go to any nut-houses again."

08:30 **End of Philippines sequence**

08:31 British interviewer at overseas press conference: "Do any of you have plans to record on your own?"

08:37 Paul: (quietly surprised) "English voice!"

08:38 John: "We do at home. We might."

08:43 George: "In fact, we have done, I think."

08:44 John: "Have we?"

08:45 George: "Well, I think that Eleanor Rigby was Paul on his own."

08:48 John: "We were just drinking tea."

09:15 _Eleanor Rigby_ performed with acoustic guitar in the 90s by Paul using an American accent, in moody half-lit black and white

09:45 Transitions to original recording over footage of children playing in post-war austerity

10:45 Back to Paul finishing the song with Country singer style "Yeah, yeah-yeah".

10:47 Brian Epstein at press conference: "I have prepared a statement, which I will read, which has had John Lennon's absolute approval this afternoon with myself by telephone. And this is as follows. The quote which John Lennon made to a London columnist more than three months ago has been quoted and represented entirely out of context."

11:15 George Martin: "I mean, early in 1966, John gave an interview to Maureen Cleave, do you remember her, at the Evening Standard, in which he made a chance remark saying, "We, the Beatles, are more popular than Jesus Christ."

11:27 Paul: "**Was it a mistake? I don't know. In the short term, yeah, maybe not in the long term.** He said, 'I don't know what's wrong with the church at the moment. The Beatles are bigger than Jesus Christ. They're not building Jesus enough. They ought to do more like gospel and all this stuff.' Well, that was taken out of context over in America."

11:45 George: "So there was, y'know, all this big palava going on. **And anyway, we got to America.** I think we did a press conference where John basically, under the pressure of the cameras and the press, and, y'know, just the stress of having to deal with this thing that he, in effect, had caused."

12:08 John: (at press conference) "If it had said television is more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it..." up to "I just said what I said and it was wrong or was taken wrong and now it's all this."

13:13 George: "The repercussions were big..." to the Alabama DJ: "... turn them in this week if possible."

13:56 John: "Well, the photos we saw of them were a sort of middle-aged DJs and 12-year-olds burning a pile of LP covers."

14:02 Ringo: "Millions of kids were burning the Beatle records. There was bonfires of them, which is okay for us because then they re-bought them."

14:09 Racist in stupid hat: "The Beatles made a statement in all the newspapers that they're getting more better than Jesus himself, and the Ku Klux Klan being a religious order is going to come out here the night that they appear at the Coliseum here. And we're going to demonstrate with different ways and tactics to stop this performance. The Klan is going to come out here because we're the only organization that will come out and make a stop to these accusations. This is nothing but blasphemy, **and we're going to try to stop it. Any terror way we can is going to stop - we're known as a terror organization. I think we have ways and means to stop this if this is going to be the case.**"

14:50 Reporter: "What ways and means?"

14:52 Racist in stupid hat: "Well, I don't want to say this, but there'll be a lot of surprises Monday night, I believe, when they get here."

14:58 John: "People always got the image I was anti-Christ or anti-religious. I'm not at all. I'm a most religious fellow."

15:23 _I'm Only Sleeping_

16:16 Reporter at Shea Stadium: "Well, it looks like the bloom is off the Beatles. Last year, not an empty seat in Shea Stadium..." up to "They've only sold 50,000 seats."

16:48 Ringo: "It's all over for the Beatles, **says Roger Whitaker of the Dallas Times.**"

16:54 George: "Okay, I don't ever remember going there twice."

16:57 Reporter: "Now tell me the truth. Are you really a Beatles fan or are you here because it's the right thing to do?" up to Fan 1: "I think they're still strong."

17:11 Reporter: "Do you think the Beatles are out of style?"

17:12 Fan 2: "Never. They'll never go out of style."

17:14 Reporter: "Tell me the truth now. Which group do you like better than the Beatles?"

17:16 Fan 2: "The Beatles all the time. I love them."

17:19 Reporter: "Don't you think this whole Beatle craze is sort of silly and strictly for girls?"

17:23 Fan 3: "No, not really. I think they're very talented musicians and talented songwriters and excellent showmen."

17:28 Reporter: "You like them?"

17:29 Fan 3: "Yeah."

17:30 Reporter: "How long do you think they can last?"

17:32 Fan 3: "As long as they keep playing, they'll last."

17:35 Fan 4: "Y'know, the Beatles bring joy into the world. They're happiness. We forget our cares when we hear Beatle records. They're fun."

17:43 Reporter: "Tell me this, how long do you think the Beatles can last?"

17:46 Fan 5: "Well, I wish they'd last forever, they could bring happiness to everybody."

17:49 Stooge: "They're less popular than they were months ago."

17:53 Reporter: "I bet there's another group you like better now than the Beatles" up to Stooge answering: "Herman and the Hermits."

17:59 John: (being interviewed) "It doesn't matter about people not liking our records or not liking the way we look. Or what we say. They're entitled to not like us. We're entitled not to have anything to do with them if we don't want to. Or not to regard them. We've all got our rights, y'know, Harold."

18:15 George: "There was this other thing of this woman who was the famous psychic or something. She was supposed to be. She'd predicted Kennedy's assassination and various other things. And she was saying in the papers about how the Beatles were going to die in a plane crash.

18:32 George Martin: "All along this time, there were also death threats they were getting..." up to "And so were the boys."

19:09 Paul: "Generally, it's how much of a good thing can you have? How long can you sustain things? And we'd, every tour, we'd gone, 'It's gone great, it's gone marvellous.' But we were getting a bit fed up anyway, just 'cause we'd been at it so long, and it gets gruelling, and another Holiday Inn after another. Y'know, y'know that. We all know that."

19:25 George: "And just the general Beatlemania was, y'know, it took its toll, and also because we were seeing it then from as no longer as, like, a naive kind of, y'know, just on the buzz of our fame and success. Y'know, by this time, I mean, the dental experience had, y'know, had kind of made us see it from a different light, and it was no longer fun any more."

19:55 Ringo: "I don't think anyone didn't want to stop touring..." up to Paul: "...try and keep some fun in it for yourself in anything you do, y'know?"

21:04 Paul: "And we'd been pretty good at that. We'd enjoyed touring, then we'd enjoyed doing a bit of TV, we'd enjoyed Europe, we'd enjoyed America. Wow. But now even America was beginning to pale, y'know, because of these conditions you've mentioned and the fact that we'd done it so many times."

21:19 Paul: "So by then, it was like, yeah, well, don't tell anyone, but this is probably our last gig."

21:23 Ringo: "Yeah, see, there was big talk at Candlestick Park, about that very period about, y'know, 'This has got to end. This is it.' But my, we went on further than that. We got back to England before we finally said, that's it."

21:41 George: "I certainly felt that that was it..." up to John: "I think you might have enjoyed it. I'm sorry for them, yeah."

22:20 _For No One_, complete song over montage of the touring years, working back through time all the way to the Cavern.

24:12 Brian Epstein: "The Beatles were then just four lads on that rather dimly lit stage..." up to actor John's line "He said 'Green, green, green,' so I did."

26:00 Additional scene from _How I Won The War_ with somewhat better acting from John.

26:35 Neil Aspinall: "Ringo came to Spain, right, to Almeria when John and I were down there..." up to George: "... and he was going on about this idea of, y'know, some fictitious band."

41:41 John: "Sgt. Pepper is Paul after a trip to America, and the whole West Coast long-named group thing was coming in. Y'know, when people are no longer the Beatles or the Crickets, they were suddenly Fred and his Incredible Sheep-Shrinking Grateful Aeroplanes, right?"

41:58 Paul: "At the time, there were lots of those sort of bands that were..." up to Neil Aspinall: "So we liked that idea."

43:30 Paul: "And one of the things I know, we'd read a report somewhere that had said, 'Elvis Presley has sent his gold-plated Cadillac out on tour.' And we just thought that was like the greatest idea going, 'cause we'd been touring and sending ourselves out. We thought, 'That's a really good idea. You stay at home and send your car.' And true enough, it did go on tour and people had come and they'd pay money and just wander around it like it was an exhibit at Madame Tussauds or something, y'know. And he didn't have to be there. So at the time in the '60s, when we were thinking of doing Sgt. Pepper, which is when we didn't want to tour, that idea suddenly sounded very nifty, y'know. So we said, 'Well, we haven't got gold-bladed Cadillacs. We don't do that stuff.' But we could send a record of ours on tour."

44:15 Ringo: "I mean, it was Sgt. Pepper and his lonely heart sort of band and all these other acts..." up to Paul: "Just a little poetic jumble that sounded nice."

48:23 George Martin: "**Probably the most momentous song on the album, _A Day in the Life_, began in a very simple way.** And we've got the rehearsal take, take one, the very first time we heard it..." up to Paul: "And it was a little sort of look of recognition between us, like, 'Do it, do it, get it down.'"

52:47 _A Day in the Life_, complete song over the footage of the orchestral recording session attended by various Stones and Monkees, ending with animation of the record sleeve being painted like a colouring book as the final piano chord dies away.

57:14 Ringo: "So, y'know, the sleeve came and we wanted to dress up..." up to the end of the reprise.

58:00 Paul: "I remember the weekend it was released..." up to "It was like you were making it for us, our crowd."

58:16 George Martin: "I think it did represent what the young people were on about. And it seemed to coincide with a revolution in young people's thinking. And it was the kind of, I suppose, the epitome of the swinging 60s."

58:30 George Martin: "It's sort of linked up with Mary Quentin miniskirts and all that kind of thing And dope to a certain extent. Y'know, the freedom of sex, the freedom of soft drugs like marijuana and so on. I suppose that was all a bit exciting. And I think it did reflect its time."

58:47 Paul: "I thought it was great. I thought it was a huge advance. I was very pleased because the newspapers, the musical papers had been saying recently, a month or two before, what were the Beatles up to? Drying up, I suppose. And so it was nice making an album like Pepper thinking, yeah, drying up, I suppose that's right. So it was lovely to have that on them. When it came out, I loved it. I kind of had a party, sort of celebrate. That weekend was a bit of a party, as I recall. And I remember getting lots of telegrams, as I say, from people.

59:24 Paul: "And the biggest single sort of tribute for me was... he'd only add since the Friday to learn it."

59:43 Jimi Hendrix, performing the title track for a whole verse/chorus

01:00:01 Ringo: "**Sgt. Pepper for me was great because I, it's a fine album.** It's a fine album, but I did learn to play chess on it. Because I'd have so much spare time, y'know. We'd do the basic track and then we'd put other stuff on. And then the percussion would be overdubbed later and later, y'know."

01:00:22 George: "**For me it was kind of a bit tiring or it was a bit boring because, I mean,** I had a few moments in there that I enjoyed, but generally I didn't really like that album much..." up to George Martin: "They were just, looked like stars to me at the time."

01:02:46 Interviewer: "Paul, how often have you taken LSD?"

01:02:49 Paul: (being interviewed) "About four times."

01:02:52 Paul: "The man at the time, the newscaster, showed up and said, 'Is it true you've had drugs?' And I made a sort of lightning decision. I thought, well, I'm either going to sort of try and bluff this. They're at my door. I can't, y'know, go, 'No, no, no. Go away.' Or I'm just going to tell him. Sod it, y'know."

01:03:09 Paul: "But I did talk to him beforehand and I said, look, y'know what's going to happen here? I'm going to get the blame for telling everyone I take drugs..." up to Ringo: "Which we did with all love, because, y'know, we loved each other."

01:04:38 Ringo: "But I could have done without it myself."

01:04:41 John: "Now, the point about the whole drug scene was, the press asked Paul, 'Have you taken LSD?' This is how it all came out. Otherwise, we didn't say a word about it, y'know. I mean, it was just a personal thing, right?"

01:04:55 Ringo: "Well, you see, I feel to this day that, y'know, we did take certain substances..." up to "It didn't work for the Beatles, to be too deranged when making music."

01:06:03 _Baby You're a Rich Man_ over home movies of the Beatles checking out a possible Greek island they might buy

01:06:06 George: "I thought somebody had said you should invest some money, and we thought, 'Well, let's buy an island.' We'd just go there and drop out. We rented a boat, and we drove this boat up and down the coast from Athens, looking at islands, and we came to this island that we arranged to go and see."

01:06:29 Song and footage continues, showing Beatles and entourage, partners and infant Julian.

01:07:53 Ringo: "And it came to nothing. We didn't buy an island, we came home."

EP7 00:27 **The _All You Need Is Love_ sequence, presented at [the start of Episode 7](#7&dvd0) in the DVD version, has been both modified and moved to the end of Episode 6 for Disney+. It is included here for comparison.** John: "We're sorry, now, but there's plenty of people in England that haven't seen us unless we do a world telly show..." up to George: "And it was probably the very earliest technology that enabled that kind of satellite link."

EP7 00:55 George Martin: "John wrote _All You Need Is Love_ especially for the television show."

EP7 01:00 George Martin: "It was a commission that Brian suddenly weighed well in and said, 'We are to represent Britain in this round-the-world hookup, and you've got to write a song.'"

EP7 01:08 George: "Because the mood of the time, it seemed to be a great idea to do that song, because while everybody else was showing them people knitting in Canada and Irish clock dancers in Venezuela, we thought, well, we'll just sing _All You Need Is Love_, because it's a kind of subtle bit of PR for God, basically."

EP7 01:33 George: "And I don't know if the song was written before that, because we were making an album at the time..." up to Ringo: "It was a fabulous time, musically and spiritually."

EP7 02:50 George Martin: "And we had prepared a track, a basic track for the recording, for the television show. But we were going to do a lot live."

EP7 02:59 George Martin: "And there was an orchestra that was live..." up to "The man upstairs pointed his finger, and that's it. We did it one take."

EP7 03:40 _All You Need Is Love_ live broadcast
