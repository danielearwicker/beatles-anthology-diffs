Anthology, 2003 DVD Version: Episode 3

00:25 Paul: "Congratulations lads, number one in U.S. Charts."

00:29 George: "lt was a great feeling because we were booked to go there directly after the Paris trip so it was handy to have a number one."

00:39 Interviewer: "John, so far, all British pop stars have not made a tremendous impact on the States. How do you think you're going to fare?"

00:45 John: "Well, I can't really say, can I? I mean, is it up to me? No. I mean, I just hope we go all right, y'know."

00:53 George: "**But at that time I didn't realise that Capitol Records had been told, y'know, you can, they wanted to have the Beatles, you see. Then Brian Epstein said, okay, well, you can have them then, on condition you spend $70,000, which sounded enormous, but they did, so that was part of the deal. They had to promote us, but I think there was more to it than that. They had a catchy single that took off. Plus,** Ed Sullivan had seen us in England, and all the time and life, and Newsweek had all put covers of the Beatles on their magazines prior to us arriving, so it was a surprise, though, because we thought we'd have to work a little bit for this notoriety."

01:36 Brian Epstein: "If [there was a turning point in their career, a specific date on which the breadth and scope of their future was to be altered, then it was the day their Pan Am jet touched down at Kennedy International in New York to a welcome which has seldom been equalled anywhere in history.](#2&dplus74)" (Moved back to end of Episode 2)

02:01 Press Conference, US.

02:19 John: "Oh, we're all bald. **And deaf and dumb, too.**"

03:00 Paul: "I remember, for instance, the great moment of going into the limo and putting on the radio, and there we were on American radio," up to the arrival at the hotel.

05:18 John: We were so overawed by American radio..." up to the end of _All My Loving_ on the Ed Sullivan show.

12:33 Ed Sullivan on the Elvis telegram

12:45 George: "Later they said there was the least reported, or there was no reported crime. Even the criminals had a rest for like 10 minutes while we were on."

12:59 Ringo: "And then we did the train ride to Washington."

14:01 Neil Aspinall: "We did that Washington show. It was like a boxing ring, right, with people all round. Every song, you'd go to a different side of the stage, right, and so you'd have to move the mics all the time, y'know? And Ringo was sitting on a, like this round thing in the middle of the stage, that his drums were on so he had to turn that round to face whichever way the band were playing, and the bloody thing got stuck."

15:45 _She Loves You_ Live at Washington Coliseum

18:11 Paul: "The song we'd like to carry on with now, is one which we recorded on an LP that we made, that's English for album, an album that we made, we'd like you, like you, if you would, to join in, and clap your hands, y'know, and stamp your feet _[John demonstrates, but is somehow unable to clap his hands or stamp his feet very well 🤔]_ The song's called _I Saw Here Standing There_."

18:45 _I Saw Her Standing There_ Live at Washington Coliseum

21:45 Paul: "We would like to sing a song now which was a record for us and it was our first hit in England. In England, way back in England. And this song was released in America. It didn't do anything. It was released later again. And... it's doing something, y'know. _[laughter from the others]_ So, this, yeah, it is. So, so we'd like to play for you now a song called _Please, Please Me_."

18:45 _Please Please Me_ Live at Washington Coliseum

24:23 Paul: "Yeah, the British Embassy, it was, there was a kind of party, y'know, so this was one of the things..." up to John storming out after Ringo's unwanted haircut.

25:29 Paul: (on camera) "And then we eventually, as you say, got down to Miami, which was, well, I mean, that was just like Paradise. Because, I mean, we'd never been to anywhere where there was palm trees. And we took a lot of photos, y'know, we were like tourists, and we had our _[cheesy effect of camera flashing]_ Pentax cameras."

25:45 _I'll Follow the Sun_ (over Miami holiday photos, whole song with no VO)

27:32 Paul: "We had a great time there, we stayed in a hotel most of the time and sort of looked down on the sand where the kids, the fans would write I LOVE JOHN on the sand, y'know, so you could read it from your hotel room. I remember playing at one of the hotels, and they always have cabarets."

27:57 Ringo: "This was just the most brilliant place I'd ever been to, and people were lending us yachts or anything we wanted. I mean, this family lent us their boat, and they let me drive a 60-foot yacht. Y'know, a speedboat, which I proceeded to bring in to port, head-on, not really knowing much about driving speedboats. And so y'know they have those pretty rails on the front hanging out, well this was... and just bent the bugger all over the place. But they didn't seem to mind, they were just happy."

28:35 Paul: (on second Ed Sullivan show) "Thank you very much indeed. Thank you very much. Well, uh, yeah. For the next, for the next song that we'd like to sing, this is one in which, yeah okay hang on, shh, hang on. This is a song..."

28:57 John: "Shut up while he's talking!"

28:59 Paul: "Yeah!"

29:02 Ed Sullivan introduces the second Beatles show, up to the interview back in London ending with George saying "What money?"

34:18 Opening chord of _A Hard Day's Night_

34:18 John: "You went to see those movies with Elvis or somebody in it when we were still in Liverpool, and you'd see everybody waiting to see him, right? And I'd be waiting there, too, and they'd all scream when he came on the screen. So we thought, 'That's a good job.'" (Although this has been removed in Disney+, it has [already appeared in Episode 1.](#1&dvd58))

34:35 Paul: "We'd always, y'know, I'm talking about this progression with the Beatles from, y'know, little Stevedores and Dockers Union" up to where Spike Milligan walks slowly to the camera and is then punched in the face, and Paul continues talking about Richard Lester.

36:29 Paul: "... And he got hold of Alan Owen, who was a Welsh playwright, **who'd written Last Tram to Lime Street, I think. I mean, Last Tram to Lime, I was a play about Lime Street, it's a little bit long ago now, but it was a very good play with Billy Whitelaw, and a very good teleplay that Alan had got known for.** And so he was a very likeable Welsh bloke, and he came and he hung out with us for a few days..." up to the end of _If I Fell_ from the film.

45:18 Brian Matthew: "The next few minutes are in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles..." Interview about making film.

46:27 John: "All of us like the bit in the field, we all jump about like lunatics, because that's pure film, as the director told us. Y'know, it's just pure filming, and we could have been anybody, but we enjoy that."

46:40 _Can't Buy Me Love_ continues, up to John reading _The Wrestling Dog_ on _Not Only But Also_.

49:31 Dudley Moore: "Mr. John Lennon **will be back with the answers later on in the program.**"

49:48 Paul: "John used to do that from an early age actually had a little fancy for that kind of thing. When he was a school he used to do a thing called the Daily Howl which was like a comic, we used to draw all the things, and it'll be little jokes and 'Today will be muggy, followed by tuggy, weggy and thurgy.' Y'know a little, real little sort of teenage jokes as we used to do a lot of that" (Pages from the comic)

50:10 Scenes of Brian Epstein as his assistant explains how to pronounce his name, up to George: "Remember we played in Amsterdam was when Derek first became, like, on tour with us."

41:18 George Martin: "We nearly didn't do that tour."

42:52 Ringo: "Yes, I was desperately ill, I was having my tonsils out.

51:26 George Martin: "George is very loyal person and he said if Ringo is not part of the group It's not Beatles, said I don't see we should do it. I'm not gonna go."

51:34 George: "**[edit]** Yeah, I really despise the way we couldn't ever make a decision for ourselves...

51:48 Jimmie drumming as the three healthy Beatles surround him

51:50 George Martin: "And Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo's parts very well and obviously he had to rehearse with them and got to know the songs very well."

52:00 Ringo: "It was very strange, and, y'know, because I was it wasn't well and they'd taken Jimmie Nicols [sic] and I thought they didn't love me anymore, and all that stuff went through my head."

52:20 _Long Tall Sally_ with Jimmie Nicol up to _You Can't Do That_ live in Australia with Ringo.

01:06:21 John: "**I think when we made _A Hard Day's Night_, The Beatles**, because there was a lot of comedy in it, people were saying, 'Oh, y'know, they're the young Marx brothers.' I think there's nothing else, there'd never been a group of four people, I suppose, doing comedy besides them."

01:06:31 Paul: "Yeah, we were called the sort of Britain's answer to the Marx brothers and stuff like that, and it was very well received, and it did very well."

01:06:39 George: "But I think that was part of the thing, that the Beatles were very funny. I mean, they actually were funny."

01:06:45 Ringo: "I found it exciting. I loved it."

01:06:49 John: "And when you first see yourself on a big screen, you just watch yourself..." up to "... we went back and it was one of the best ever."

01:10:19 _I'll Be Back_ outtakes over the closing credits, including an early attempt in waltz time.
