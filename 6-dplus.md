00:19 Racist in stupid hat: "The Beatles made a statement in all the newspapers that they're getting more better than Jesus himself, and the Ku Klux Klan being a religious order is going to come out here the night that they appear at the Coliseum here. And we're going to demonstrate with different ways and tactics to stop this performance. The Klan is going to come out here because we're the only organization that will come out and make a stop to these accusations. This is nothing but blasphemy. **[edit]**"

01:04 George Martin: "I mean, early in 1966, John gave an interview to Maureen Cleave, do you remember her, at the Evening Standard, in which he made a chance remark saying, "We, the Beatles, are more popular than Jesus Christ."

01:16 Brian Epstein at press conference: "I have prepared a statement, which I will read, which has had John Lennon's absolute approval this afternoon with myself by telephone. And this is as follows. The quote which John Lennon made to a London columnist more than three months ago has been quoted and represented entirely out of context."

01:41 Paul: "**[edit]** He said, 'I don't know what's wrong with the church at the moment. The Beatles are bigger than Jesus Christ. They're not building Jesus enough. They ought to do more like gospel and all this stuff.' Well, that was taken out of context over in America."

01:53 George: "The repercussions were big..." to the Alabama DJ: "... turn them in this week if possible."

02:23 George: "So there was, y'know, all this big palava going on. **[edit]** I think we did a press conference where John basically, under the pressure of the cameras and the press, and, y'know, just the stress of having to deal with this thing that he, in effect, had caused."

02:44 John: (at press conference) "If it had said television is more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it..." up to "I just said what I said and it was wrong or was taken wrong and now it's all this."

04:01 _I'm Only Sleeping_

04:57 John: "People always got the image I was anti-Christ or anti-religious. I'm not at all. I'm a most religious fellow."

05:08 George Martin: "All along this time, there were also death threats they were getting..." up to "And so were the boys."

05:44 Ringo: "**[edit]** Y'know, I was always on a high riser..." up to "And this guy was just sitting there." [This anecdote has moved here from episode 4.](#4&dvd38)

06:22 George: "**[edit]** Some people would set up firecrackers in the hall and you'd think someone of the others got shot, or something."

06:28 John: "On stage I always feel safe, y'know, I just feel as though I'm alright when I'm plugged in, and I don't feel as though they'll get me." _Fade is preserved (unusual), though not as pronounced._ [Moved here from episode 4.](#4&dvd40)

06:39 Reporter: "Now tell me the truth. Are you really a Beatles fan or are you here because it's the right thing to do?" up to the New York fan: "I think they're still strong."

06:53 Ringo: "Well that's really surprising because I thought we only played there once."

06:57 George: "You mean we played Shea Stadium twice?"

07:00 Ringo: "It's just getting all blended here."

07:03 George: "Okay, I don't ever remember going there twice.

07:06 Ringo: "How was it?"

07:08 Reporter at Shea Stadium: "Well, it looks like the bloom is off the Beatles. Last year, not an empty seat in Shea Stadium..." up to "They've only sold 50,000 seats."

07:35 Ringo: "It's all over for the Beatles. **[edit]**"

07:38 Reporter: "I bet there's another group you like better now than the Beatles" up to Stooge answering: "Herman and the Hermits."

07:44 Reporter: "Tell me the truth now. Which group do you like better than the Beatles?"

07:46 Fan 2: "The Beatles all the time. I love them."

07:48 Reporter: "Tell me this, how long do you think the Beatles can last?"

07:51 Fan 5: "Well, I wish they'd last forever, they could bring happiness to everybody."

07:54 Reporter: "How long do you think they're going to last?"

07:56 Fan 3: "As long as they keep playing, they'll last."

07:59 George: "Even going back to '65, that's when I was saying, I don't want to do this any more. I don't like this."

08:06 George: "Y'know, these ticker-tape parades that they were trying to do, and the... Y'know, I mean, it was that... It was nice to be popular, but when you saw the size of it, it was just ridiculous. It was dangerous."

08:19 George: "It felt dangerous..." up to "Everybody else was going mad. **[edit]**" [Moved here from episode 5.](#5&dvd17)

08:38 George: "So for a year or so, I'd been saying, 'Let's not do this any more.' And then, anyway, it played itself out. But by '66, everybody was feeling that that's it. We've got to stop this."

08:51 Ringo: "I don't think anyone didn't want to stop touring..." up to Paul: "...try and keep some fun in it for yourself in anything you do, y'know?"

10:01 Paul: "So by then, it was like, yeah, well, don't tell anyone, but this is probably our last gig."

10:05 George: "I certainly felt that that was it..." up to John: "I think you might have enjoyed it. I'm sorry for them, yeah."

10:45 _For No One_, retaining the montage (with restored footage and smoothed slow-motion) but shortened by skipping the middle chunk of the song including the horn solo.

12:01 Brian Epstein: "The Beatles were then just four lads on that rather dimly lit stage..." up to actor John's line "He said 'Green, green, green,' so I did."

13:47 Neil Aspinall: "Ringo came to Spain, right, to Almeria when John and I were down there..." up to George: "... and he was going on about this idea of, y'know, some fictitious band." _An unusually long sequence that is structurally unchanged, including two complete promo films and the arrival of four moustaches._

28:31 Paul: "At the time, there were lots of those sort of bands that were..." up to Neil Aspinall: "So we liked that idea."

30:02 Ringo: "**It was gonna be a show album.** I mean, it was Sgt. Pepper and his lonely heart sort of band and all these other acts..." up to Paul: "Just a little poetic jumble that sounded nice."

34:12 George Martin: "**[edit]** And we've got the rehearsal take, take one, the very first time we heard it..." up to Paul: "And it was a little sort of look of recognition between us, like, 'Do it, do it, get it down.'"

38:34 _A Day in the Life_, joining it at the last verse, so greatly shortened footage of the orchestral recording session, cutting before the final piano chord.

39:32 Paul: "The big grand pianos at the end I was very into, if you listen - _[strikes a piano chord using sustain pedal]_, if you stick a mic on that, that'll go on for about a minute and a half. Should we listen? No, we haven't got time. It's still there, and that'll go on forever, and that was just one of the little things that fascinated me, so I kind of brought that to the session, I said, how about - still there! Can you hear it? Bring the mic in, and if you bring the mic in and in and in, it's still there. So, y'know, I did this thing so we got everyone on grand pianos all doing a big thing."

40:05 Animation of the record sleeve being painted like a colouring book as the final piano chord dies away.

40:08 Ringo: "So, y'know, the sleeve came and we wanted to dress up..." up to the end of the reprise.

40:59 John: "And if you look closely at the album cover, you'll see two people who are flying and two who aren't. That's just a little in joke. Two of them didn't share it with two others."

41:12 Paul: "I remember the weekend it was released..." up to "It was like you were making it for us, our crowd."

41:28 George Martin: "It's sort of linked up with Mary Quentin miniskirts and all that kind of thing And dope to a certain extent. Y'know, the freedom of sex, the freedom of soft drugs like marijuana and so on. I suppose that was all a bit exciting. And I think it did reflect its time."

41:46 Paul: "And the biggest single sort of tribute for me was... he'd only add since the Friday to learn it."

42:06 Jimi Hendrix, performing the title track, cut down to the last chorus.

42:10 George Martin: "Pepper, of course when looking back on Pepper, it was quite an icon. It was the record of that time, and it probably did change the face of recording. But we didn't do it consciously."

42:23 John: "It wasn't like nine months in the studio, it was nine months over a period. And we'd do a section and then stop and then come back in, if I can remember it right. And I like to just get in and out, y'know, I get a bit bored."

42:35 Ringo: "**[edit]** It's a fine album, but I did learn to play chess on it. Because I'd have so much spare time, y'know. We'd do the basic track and then we'd put other stuff on. And then the percussion would be overdubbed later and later, y'know."

42:48 George: "**[edit]** I had a few moments in there that I enjoyed, but generally I didn't really like that album much..." up to George Martin: "They were just, looked like stars to me at the time."

45:26 Ringo: "Well, you see, I feel to this day that, y'know, we did take certain substances..." up to "It didn't work for the Beatles, to be too deranged when making music."

46:14 John: "Now, the point about the whole drug scene was, the press asked Paul, 'Have you taken LSD?' This is how it all came out. Otherwise, we didn't say a word about it, y'know. I mean, it was just a personal thing, right?"

46:27 Paul: "But I did talk to him beforehand and I said, look, y'know what's going to happen here? I'm going to get the blame for telling everyone I take drugs..." up to Ringo: "Which we did with all love, because, y'know, we loved each other."

47:55 John: **The _All You Need Is Love_ sequence, presented at the start of Episode 7 in the DVD version, has been moved to the end of Episode 6 for Disney+.** "We're sorry, now, but there's plenty of people in England that haven't seen us unless we do a world telly show..." up to George: "And it was probably the very earliest technology that enabled that kind of satellite link."

48:32 George Martin: "It was a commission that Brian suddenly weighed well in and said, 'We are to represent Britain in this round-the-world hookup, and you've got to write a song.'"

48:42 George Martin: "It was a challenge. It was within two weeks, I think, we had to get it together. And then we learned it was going to be, for that time, a phenomenal figure of over 200 million people watching."

48:53 George: "And I don't know if the song was written before that, because we were making an album at the time..." up to Ringo: "It was a fabulous time, musically and spiritually."

50:10 George: "We decided to get some people in who looked like the love generation. And I think if you look close on the floor, I know there's Mick Jagger's there, but there's also Eric Clapton, I believe, in full psychedelic regalia and permed hair, sitting right there."

50:31 George Martin: "And there was an orchestra that was live..." up to "The man upstairs pointed his finger, and that's it. We did it one take."

51:12 _All You Need Is Love_ live broadcast

54:13 George: "Because the mood of the time, it seemed to be a great idea to do that song, because while everybody else was showing them people knitting in Canada and Irish clock dancers in Venezuela, we thought, well, we'll just sing _All You Need Is Love_, because it's a kind of subtle bit of PR for God."
