00:06 Titles (completely re-rendered)

00:34 Liver Building, Mersey river

00:57 _In My Life_ montage begins - main changes are colour correction (sky is white over roof-top concert) and slow-motion clips have been AI enhanced to simulate higher frame rate.

02:22 Clip of Derek Taylor and Mal Evans together

03:23 Opening titles of _Help!_

03:31 Cycling scene from _Help!_ (restored a la Blu Ray edition)

03:43 "Let's go back 'n back 'n..." high speed photo montage. Many photos re-sourced in higher quality with colour correction, cropped differently, some now in colour for the first time, several have been mirrored left/right, and some replaced with different photos entirely:

03:57 _We'll Meet Again_

04:56 George: "My father was driving a bus at the time I was born, and I lived in a two-up and two-down, 12 Arnold Grove." _(Very similar but not identical take)_

05:20 Footage of soldiers marching in formation. Ringo: "We were all roughly the same age and we were like, the first group of people who didn't go in the army."

05:29 Paul: "My mum was a nurse..." - some photos cropped differently but broadly the same until...

06:15 George: "Uncles who had bald heads, who used to say they got their bald heads by knocking pub doors open!"

06:54 George: "In those days they had those radios like crystal sets. You used to have to take the battery down to some shop on the corner and then leave it with them for three days to charge it up."

07:01 Ringo: "Everybody has their party piece in Liverpool. You have to sing a song, and my mother's was _Little Drummer Boy_, she would sing to me, and I would sing _Nobody's Child_ to her, and she'd always cry! I'm nobody's child, _mum_." (Processed by MAL to remove sound of interviewer Jools Holland laughing.)

07:17 Paul: "John really loved his mother, 'cause she was great, I loved her too. And she played a little ukulele."

07:24 John: "And then unfortunately she was run over by an off-duty policeman who was drunk at the time."

07:29 Paul: "My mum had died, actually, at this point, I think mum died when I was 14, which is, y'know, the big shock in my teenage years, she died of cancer. And John's mum having died, this was always a very big bond between John and I.

07:44 _C'mon Everybody_ (identical John V/O)

08:00 _Rocket '88_ - John: "There was no such thing as an English record, y'know. I think the first English record that was anywhere near anything was _Move It_ by Cliff Richard, and before that there'd been nothing."

08:16 John: "But the fact was, there hadn't been a history of making that kind of music. Whereas there had in America."

08:21 _Ain't That a Shame_

08:31 Paul: "You can't imagine a time when rock and roll was only one of the musics".

08:45 _No Other Love Have I_ - George: "Whatever record was being played, you try'd and listen to it. Y'know, you couldn't even get a cup o' sugar, let alone a rock and roll record."

09:48 John: "When I went to art school, I was at art school for five years, this was a sort of college, they would only allow jazz to be played, they wouldn't allow rock and roll, it was frowned upon in those days, so we had to con them into letting us play rock and roll on the record player by calling it blues, y'know."

09:00 _That's Alright Mama_

09:08 Paul: "I remember being in school when I was a kid and somebody had a picture in one of the musical papers of Elvis..."

09:40 _Hound Dog_ live performance

10:08 _I'm In Love Again_ over footage of a jukebox - George: "When I **[edit]** was about 12 or 13 when I first heard Fats Domino. _I'm In Love Again_, that's I think what I would call the first rock and roll record I heard. And then later on Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Buddy Holly."

10:30 _Peggy Sue_ live performance

10:42 Paul: "There were lots of people coming up then. And one of them was Buddy Holly. We loved his vocal sound and we loved his guitar playing. But most of all I think was the fact that he wrote the stuff himself. That's what turned us on."

10:56 _When Did You Leave Heaven_ - George: "We got to hear people like Big Bill Broonzy, I think he might even have done a tour of England."

11:24 Ringo: "I was a big fan of his, and, actually, Frankie Laine."

11:27 _Jezebel_

11:37 Ringo: "I was listening to a lot of Country and Western then, Skiffle was coming through."

11:42 John: "Y'know, all those train songs, and y'know, Rock Island Line, all that stuff."

11:46 _Rock Island Line_

11:59 George: "I think the first music I can remember hearing as guitar-oriented music was this record my dad brought from New York, it was a guy called Jimmie Rodgers, The Singing Breakman."

12:13 _T for Texas_

12:26 Ringo: "I went to see _Rock Around the Clock_ in the Isle of Man, my grandparents took me there after I came out of hospital, and it was just sensational because they ripped up the cinema, and this was good for me to see."

12:40 _Rock Around the Clock_

12:42 George: "In those days, y'know, they say beggars can't be choosers, and we we're just desperate, you'd just get anything, whatever film came, you'd just try and see it." (All reaction noises from Jools Holland removed by MAL.)

12:54 _Ready Teddy_ from _The Girl Can't Help It_ (restored, widescreen)

13:00 Paul: "So when _The Girl Can't Help It_ came along, instead of us looking at these old black and white movies **[edit]**, suddenly this was in colour, and this was in widescreen, and there's a famous..." up to the clip of Jayne Mansfield. All clips, including Tom Ewell's intro, now in widescreen and restored.

14:02 John: "Y'know, you went to see those movies with somebody in it like Elvis, when we were still in Liverpool, and you'd see everybody waiting to see him, and I'd be waiting there too, and they'd all scream when he came on the screen, so we thought 'That's a good job!'"

14:17 Short extra clip of Little Richard

14:18 John: "When I was a kid I was a fan of Elvis Presley and Little Richard and Chuck Berry. I was just interested in the music, and how to do it. How can I do that? I studied the records. What do they sing? How are they doing it? How do they make this music? What is it they're doing that excites me, that I wanna do it?"

14:36 John: "And when I was 16 I re-established a relationship with my mother for about four years, she taught me music, she first of all taught me the banjo, and from that I progressed to guitar. The first song I learnt was _Ain't That A Shame_, an old rock hit, Fats Domino."

14:49 John: "It was a joke in the family, it's alright for a hobby, but it won't earn you any money."

14:54 Paul: "My dad used to be a trumpet player himself, and for my birthday he once bought me a trumpet, from Rushworth and Dreapers, which was one of the music stores in Liverpool." **Photo of the shopfront**

15:03 Paul: "But I suddenly figured out I wouldn't be able to sing with this thing stuck in me mouth. So I went back to the shop and traded it in for a guitar. So that was a Zenith. First guitar I ever had."

15:18 George: "I think hearing a little bit of guitar music, um, made me want a guitar."

15:24 George: "When I was 13, 14, I used to be at the back of the class, drawing, trying to draw guitars..." up to "I got the £3 10s from me mother, that was a lot of money in those days."

15:53 Ringo: "I used to look in shops and see drums, that's all I looked at, never looked at guitars or anything."

15:57 Ringo: "I bought a 30 bob bass drum - 30 shillings - huge mother! Just a huge one-sided bass drum. And in our area, there used to be lots and lots of parties, y'know, your uncle would play banjo, or harmonica, my grandparents played mandolin and banjo, so there was always someone playing something. And so I would play my big drum and drive 'em mad. But because I was a kid, they'd let me do it."

16:26 Paul: "George and I lived very near each other in Liverpool, in fact we were just a bus stop away from each other - I'd get on the bus, and then the stop after, George would get on. So being quite close in age we'd sit together and talk about stuff and that. **[edit]** So, I suppose I used to talk down to him a little bit **[edit]**, might have been a failing of mine, to talk down to him, 'cause I'd known him as a younger kid."

16:48 George: "He was always nine months older than I. Even now he's still nine months older than me!" (As voice over to photos of Paul, with all laughter from Jools Holland removed.)

16:56 George: "Paul and I just began to get together, played a bit, but it was just schoolboys then, there was no groups involved until a little bit later."

17:04 Jump cut to the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania performing Twist and Shout, significantly longer montage of multiple performances with many more cuts between them.

17:21 John: "Paul met me the first day I did _Be-Bop-a-Lula_ live on stage..." up to Paul: "Sure enough, note perfect, _Raunchy_. You're in."

21:21 John: "Y'know it wasn't just from '64, I was 24 in '64, and I'd been playing with Paul since I was 15... and he's very nice! And George about a year later or something, so it's a long time we spent together, in all the most extraordinary circumstances."

21:41 _That'll Be the Day_ and _In Spite of All the Danger_ by the Quarry Men, lots of hiss and crackle removed.

22:14 Paul: "I think it was starting to dawn on us that would be a good idea, if we could, to write our own stuff, 'cause there were so many people doing cover versions. And then I sang _In Spite of All the Danger_, which was a little self-penned thing, which was very influenced by Elvis."

22:32 Footage of the Jacaranda basement club switches to colour mid-sequence.

23:10 Paul: "In the early days we used to show up at gigs, with just three of us, me, George and John, with guitars, and the fellow who booked us would say 'Where's the drummer'? We'd say 'The rhythm's in the guitars.'" (This is an alternate telling of the same anecdote, this time on camera instead of over the Jacaranda footage.)

24:55 Paul: "We were all slightly jealous of John's friendship. **[edit]** So when Stuart came in, it was a little bit, he was taking a little bit of that position away from us. We had to take a little bit of a back seat."

25:56 Quarrymen tapes over recreated black and white scenery with a tape machine playing, but now with voice over toward the end from John.

26:24 John: "Instead of going to school, I'd go down to his place, he had a piano. And if I'd started something, or he'd started something, we'd say 'I've got this,' and he'd say 'I've got this,' and we'd start helping each other write our own songs, like that. So any combination of the two of us writing, that's how we wrote." Over the tape machine playing until the tape appears to run out.

26:42 George: "John and Stewart had this flat in a place called Gambier Terrace, right near the Liverpool Institute, near College of Art. And I remember one day they came up, all excited, John was saying 'I've thought of this name, The Beatles.'"

27:01 Ringo: "John thought of the name Beatles and he'll tell you about it now."

27:44 George: "Y'know, I realised by watching _The Wild Ones_, that the band - that the gang was all called The Beetles. And here it is now.

27:51 _The Wild Ones_ "...all the Beetles missed you"

28:04 New animated graphic of a logo for The Beetles morphing into the Beatles with the classic dropped T

28:28 George: "It was a pretty pathetic tour, by the end of it we were broke..."

28:53 John: "I would say to the others, when they were depressed..." up to "to the toppermost of the poppermost! I'd say 'Right!' and we'd all sort of cheer up."

29:16 George: "**And then later, Alan** came to us and said to us 'Okay, lads, you can have this job in Germany, the only problem is you've got to be five people,'" up to "He was known on Merseyside as mean, moody and magnificent: Pete Best."

29:48 John: "People who owned drum kits were far and few between, it was an expensive item."

30:09 _Roll Over Beethoven_ - much truncated montage of Hamburg lasting only 00:25 before Paul voice over begins.

30:44 Paul: "We ended up in Hamburg very late one night..." up to George: "Second night we moved into the Bambi Kino, and then we were there for like two months, three months."

31:28 George: "Everything else was such a buzz..."

32:22 _Money_ over montage of Reeperbahn club photos.

32:44 John: "In Hamburg, because we had to work six or seven hours a night..." up to "Until the pill wore off and then you'd have to have another."

33:12 George: "We used to be up there just foaming at the mouth, stomping away, doing this. Those were the days."

33:22 John: "We had to play all the tunes for hours and hours on end, that's why every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it, but we'd be playing like 8 or 10 hours a night or something, and that's what improved the playing, y'know. We thought we were the best in Hamburg and Liverpool, before anybody had heard us. We thought we were the best. Just a matter of time before everybody else caught on. And believing that is what made us what we were."

33:50 Ringo: "By the time we all met up in Germany we were playing one club, they were playing another. They were just great by then. "

33:54 John: "Ringo was a professional drummer who sang and performed, and had 'Ringo Starr Time', and he was in one of the top groups in Liverpool before we even had a drummer."

34:02 Ringo: "Because we used to do long hours, we used to do 12 hours in a weekend between two bands, and ended up on the same club and that, so if they had the last set, I'd sort of be semi-drunk, and demanding they play slow songs."

34:17 George: "We made friends with a lot of people..." up to "... and Astrid, who took all the famous photographs of us of that period."

34:32 George: "Well, She was the one that made us look good. Y'know those early Beatles photographs, the Beatles look great. She was dressed like that, the leather kecks, y'know, and the hair, like the Beatle haircuts, so they gave us the confidence to like, leave it that way."

34:48 Paul: "They weren't really rockers, or mods..." leading to truncated montage of Astrid's photos over sound clips of Beatles in Hamburg.

35:23 George: "I was 17 when we first went out there, and they had this kind of situation in Germany, which I'd never come across before... they just booted me out."

35:58 George: "So the second time we went back I was 18, this fella came into the club, who was, they said, oh, he's this famous record producer and musician, he was called Bert Kaempfert. He came in the club, and I remember this buzz went around, we've got to be good, play really good, we may get a chance to record. Which we did, and we got all pleased with ourselves, and then we got to the studio, and he just wanted us to like back up **Tony** _[somehow edited in from another mention!]_ Sheridan. Remember feeling a little depressed, but we did at least get to do that My Bonnie."

37:08 George: "**[edit]** Every time Ringo sat in..." up to "That's why he left **[edit]**, he decided to go back to art college."

38:02 George: "At that point Paul was still playing a guitar. I remember saying 'One of us is gonna be the bass player,' and I remember saying it's not me, I'm not doing it, and John said 'I'm not doing it either.'"

38:09 Paul: "I got lumbered with it really, I didn't want to be the bass player, but there was no one left, so I went, before we left Hamburg, I went and got my Hofner bass, down in the city centre."

38:23 George: "He went for it." Clips of Paul at Shea stadium, photo montage replaced by a single shot of the whole group, Paul holding his own bass.

38:44 John: "And then we went back to Liverpool and got quite a few bookings, y'know, they all thought we were German," up to Neil Aspinall: "'Cause they were using cabs at the time."

39:51 John: "I mean, on the street in Liverpool, and unless you were in the suburbs, you had to walk close to the wall, y'know? To get to the Cavern - for those of you who can remember all that - it was no easy matter, even at lunchtime, I mean it's a tense place, y'know."

40:06 George: "We played the Cavern before we ever went to Hamburg, I believe..." up to "Stop playing this music, this is a Jazz club."

40:26 Footage of stairwell of the Cavern, leading into _Kansas City_ over slowed-down footage of _Some Other Guy_ from the Granada film of the Cavern.

40:36 Paul: "So anyway, we did well at the Cavern, and attracted some big audiences," up to "So Brian suggested we just wear ordinary suits."

42:57 John: "I mean, we cleaned up a bit, Brian cleaned us up a bit, when he discovered us, or we discovered him as Paul says."

53:03 Paul: "It was later put around that I betrayed our heavy leather image..." up to "We all went quite happily."

43:20 John: "Brian put us into suits, and all that, and we made it very, very big. But we sold out, y'know."

43:25 George: "So y'know, we gladly switched into suits..." to John saying Brian "presented us well."

43:42 John: "So Brian contributed as much as us in the early days, although we were the talent and he was the hustler.

44:27 End of truncated Decca audition montage

45:04 John: "If he hadn't gone round London on foot, with the tapes under his arm, and gone from place to place, to place to place, and finally to George Martin, we would never have made it, because we didn't have the push to do it on our own."

45:31 George Martin: "And they came down here, and I spent some time with them, went through all their stuff, and tried to make up my mind which was the Cliff Richard of the group, y'know. Because one gets, one was focused, in those days, on a lead singer and a backing group. And suddenly realised at the end of it all, it was nonsense, it was a group that I had to take as it was."

45:51 John: "George had done little, no rock and roll when we met him..." to Paul: "But the thing he didn't like was our drummer."

46:40 Paul: "We really started to think we needed _the_ great drummer in Liverpool".

46:48 Ringo: "There was a Wednesday, and Brian called, **[edit]** would you join the band..."

47:28 George: "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete, and it may have been that we could have done it better, but the thing was, as history also shows, Ringo was the member of the band, it's just that he didn't enter the film until that particular scene, y'know."

47:48 John: "I met Paul and said do you wanna join me band, y'know, and then George joined, and then Ringo joined, and we were just a band who made it very, very big, that's all." Followed by long clip from Granada film of the Cavern, unchanged.

50:05 Ringo: "We played the Cavern, and there was a lot of fighting and shouting... George fought for me."

50:42 John: "What I think about the Beatles is that, even if there'd been Paul and John and two other people, we'd never have been The Beatles. It had to be that combination of Paul, John, George and Ringo to make the Beatles."

51:00 George Martin: "Ringo turns up expecting to play. I said, well, y'know, I've been bitten once, I'm not going to have that. I don't even know who you are."

51:07 Paul: "He'd originally told us he wanted another drummer besides Pete Best. We'd gone away, we'd changed, we'd brought the new drummer, the best in Liverpool, and now he didn't like the new drummer."

51:17 George Martin: "I'd already booked Andy White. I'd told Brian Epstein I was going to do this, and said I just want the three others, that's fine."

51:24 George Martin: "We're going to have Andy White, thank you very much."

51:26 George Martin: "And I then had to find a hit song for them. The best I could find from them was _Love Me Do_."

51:30 Ringo: "No, I was devastated, I came down ready to roll, and... 'We've got Andy White, the professional drummer. **[Jools Holland gets the usual MAL treatment]** But he's apologised several times since, has old George Martin..."

52:39 Brian speaks over _Love Me Do_ (Ringo version), so we only hear up to the first chorus without voice over, but it continues to play as Brian and John talk about the chart performance of the single. We hear the rest of the track over a montage of the Beatles pretending to do their hair and make-up, faces of girls in an audience, ships on the Mersey, the Beatles signing autographs, and then back to the lip sync from the beginning.

54:30 George: "We made the record of _Love Me Do_. It went to number 17, probably based upon the sales in Liverpool. EMI was kind of happy to have us back, welcome back, lads."

54:43 Paul: "We were starting to be this group that had done its own material. But normally you'd be offered a number of songs by a publisher, and they'd say 'Get your boys to do this one! This is a hit.'"

54:51 John: "When we first got in the studio they tried to give us other people's songs, they didn't like ours."

54:55 George Martin: "It was quite normal in those days to find material for artists..." up to "... and that was a song by Mitch Murray, called _How Do You Do It?_ And I was convinced this was a hit song."

55:31 John: "They forced us to do a version of _[mockingly]_ 'How do you do what you do to me, I wish I knew', y'know, like that."

55:40 George Martin: "And we did record it. John took the lead", up to _Please Please Me_, complete song performed live for TV appearance.

58:59 Cathy the gatekeeper of the Cavern: "And Bob Wooler got on the stage, telegram in his hand, I've got news for you, **edit**, and he said the Beatles' record _Please Please Me_ has reached number one in the national charts..."
