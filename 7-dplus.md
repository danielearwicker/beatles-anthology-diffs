00:30 John: "I still believe all you need is love, y'know, but I don't believe that just saying it is gonna do it, y'know, I mean I still believe in the fact that love is what we all need."

00:43 Ringo: "**[edit]** I even get excited now when I realize that's what it was for, people putting flowers in guns, San Francisco was just exploding, here was fabulous, California, where we are, LA, it was just exciting times and all for this loving feeling."

01:02 _Baby You're a Rich Man_ over the home movies of the Beatles visiting Greece, relocated from DVD Episode 6.

01:12 George: "The love generation, or whatever you want to call it, they had this kind of thing about how everybody was gonna change the world. Everybody was on such a buzz, y'know, I don't mean just the Beatles but the whole kind of planet, there's some, at least San Francisco, LA and London."

01:32 Paul: "It always seemed to be sunny, you wore these far-out clothes and these far-out little sunglasses."

01:40 Paul: "And music. The whole rest of it was just music..." up to George: "You could just pick up the vibes, y'know, **man**."

02:25 _Eight Miles High_ over a slow-mo montage of Haight-Ashbury flower children.

02:40 John: "I was all for going there and living on the Haight, y'know..." up to "George went over."

03:06 George: "Y'know, I went to Haight-Ashbury expecting it to be this brilliant place. And it was just full of **[edit]** dropout kids on drugs."

03:11 George: "It certainly showed me what was really happening in the drug cult..." up to "You should come and get initiated."

05:47 Maharishi: "I'm very happy about it, that they heard my lecture last evening..." up to Paul: "You ought to get it, I'll send you a copy."

06:06 George: "We were kind of like messengers. We were like the advance party. We were like Christopher Columbus, and we had to go out and do some discovering and then pass on the information to the ones in the next carriage behind. Like Mick Jagger!"

06:25 Paul: "It was like a school that they've taken over..." up to John: "You don't will it or use your willpower."

07:36 George: "I seem to recall it was a phone call. I don't know who took it, I think it might have been John who took the call."

07:53 John: "Well, I don't know what to say, y'know..." up to "I mean, it's only just, we've only just heard."

08:12 Paul: "**[edit]** That was kind of stunning because we were off on this sort of finding the meaning of life. And there he was, dead."

08:18 Ringo: "Our friend is gone, y'know. More our friend than anything else, y'know. Brian was a friend of ours."

08:25 Neil Aspinall: "I heard it, I heard it on the radio, actually, on the car radio, that he died."

08:31 George Martin: "The local shopkeeper said, sorry about the news. I said what news? He said your friend's died."

08:38 George: "I spoke to him Wednesday evening, the evening before we first saw Maharishi's lecture..." up to Paul: "Oh, I'm not gonna see him any more."

09:26 Paul: "I don't think there was anything sinister..." up to Ringo: "I don't think any of them set out to die."

10:24 George Martin: "Without Brian, the Beatles wouldn't have happened in the way that we know, at all. But, of course, and he was, they were his babies. He lived for the Beatles."

10:37 Reporter: "Have you a tribute you'd like to pay to Mr. Epstein?"

10:40 John: "Well, y'know, we don't know what to say. We loved him and he was one of us. So you can't, y'know..."

10:46 George: "We can't pay tribute to him in words."

10:51 _You've Got To Hide Your Love Away_, the released version, one verse/chorus.

11:46 Brian Epstein: "'Cause I've been interested in the theatre and acting a long time, and I was immediately struck by their music, their beat, and their sense of humour actually on stage, and it was there that really it all started."

20:30 John: "I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music..." up to George: "I suppose it was chaos after that."

12:33 Ringo: "We're suddenly like chickens without heads. What are we going to do? What are we going to do?"

12:38 George: "Y'know, that's where Neil kind of stepped in and tried to figure out what was happening."

12:44 Neil Aspinall: "As far as I was concerned, we had to get it together... What were the Beatles going to do?"

13:06 John: "Paul made an attempt to carry on as if Brian hadn't died. I think Paul had an impression, we should be thankful for what he did, for keeping the Beatles going."

13:16 Paul: "I know John got a bit annoyed, **but in the absence of anyone managing us, what I think I was doing was sort of from within the group, getting the group to self-manage.** It's possible that I was there more than anyone. When we did Magical Mystery Tour for instance, I ended up kind of directing it, even though we said, well, the Beatles have directed it at the end."

13:39 _Magical Mystery Tour_

14:07 George: "It was Paul's idea... It was a very flimsy kind of thing."

14:37 _You Made Me Love You_ sung in the coach by Jessie Robins, cut a few lines earlier than the DVD.

15:02 Paul: "We knew we weren't doing a regular film..." up to _The Fool on the Hill_.

16:14 George: "But, you see, there was always good songs. There was a couple of good songs. And there was a few funny scenes. I mean, the scene, to me, that stands out is the one of John shovelling the spaghetti onto the fat woman's plate. I mean, that was the best bit of the movie for me."

16:46 Paul: "That was an actual dream he'd had..." up to Ringo: "Who do they think they are? What does it mean?"

17:47 George: "They hated it. At least the people who wrote in the newspaper hated it. Y'know, they, don't forget that with all the success we'd had, every time something came out, a new record or whatever, they'd all try and slam it so that, y'know, because once they've built you up that high, y'know, all they can do is knock you back down again. I mean, that's what happens. That's life.

18:21 Ringo: "So that was really slated, but of course when people started seeing it in colour... " up to Neil Aspinall: "I think under all the circumstances it really turned out very well."

19:18 John on the Dennis Elsas show, WNEW-FM in New York on September 28, 1974: "And now we're going to play a track from Magical Mystery Tour, which is one of my favourite albums, because it was so weird. And it's _I Am The Walrus_, it's also one of my favorite tracks, because I did it of course. But also because it's one of those that has enough little bitties going to keep you interested even a hundred years later."

20:05 _I Am The Walrus_, first minute or so.

21:15 Paul: "I think we thought it was okay, I think looking back on it, I think we were quite pleased with it. At the time, it was all right, y'know, it wasn't the greatest thing we'd ever done. I defend it on the lines that nowhere else do you see a performance of _I Am The Walrus_, that's the only performance ever. **[edit]**"

21:36 John (taken from the end of Take 7 of _I'm So Tired_): "If you think it was good, keep it, if you don't, scrap it."

21:41 _Hello Goodbye_, issue with speed corrected, audio replaced with 2015 remix.

22:54 Paul (studio out-take chatter): "I think that's got it."

22:55 Ringo: "I think we've got something there George."

22:58 Bob Danvers-Walker for [Pathe News](https://youtu.be/aLeBZjPOJ-c): "Far from the noise and pace of city life in the cool clear air of Rishikesh..." up to John: "They call it the foothills hanging over the Ganges."

23:51 _Across the Universe_, Giles Martin remix of Phil Spector reproduction of George Martin production of Glyn Johns' recording, Rishikesh home movies.

25:32 Ringo: "It was pretty exciting, y'know, we're in this really, a spiritual place..." up to _Dear Prudence_.

27:18 Paul: "I wrote a couple of little things. **[edit]** I had a song called _I Will_."

27:24 _I Will_, using the same footage but with consistent orientation of Paul's guitar throughout.

27:58 The Threetles in George's garden, up to George: "just to put his toe in the water and see what it was like, maybe."

30:42 John: "We were there four months, or George and I were **[Note: actually two months]**, we lost 13 pounds and we looked a day older," up to Neil Aspinall: "You must diversify, one of those."

31:18 George: "I was still in India when it started. I think it was basically John and Paul's madness, ego, running away with themselves or with each other."

31:30 Paul: "So the big theory was that we'd put all our affairs into sort of one bundle. We'd have it as our own company. Apple would be a record label, all the things we'd ever wanted to do."

31:40 Paul (Apple launch): "It's just trying to mix business with enjoyment..." up to "They'll go to help people, but not like a charity."

31:58 Ringo: "The sole purpose of Apple was not to, people didn't have to beg any more. Artists, if they had a valid idea. We would front them. And, y'know, we had a publishing company, a record company, and we would, we could use that in these companies. But, y'know, we should have had a big sign, 'You don't have to beg.'"

32:19 George: "**[edit]** Because we got screwed in business all the time, and, y'know, how you have to go down on your knees. That was the famous one that John said, y'know, we don't want people to have to go down on their knees."

32:30 John (at press conference): "We want to set up a system whereby people who just want to make a film..." up to Paul: "Peter Asher brought along James Taylor."

33:18 _Something in the Way She Moves_ by James Taylor

33:40 Neil Aspinall: "I think Mal Evans found Badfinger. **[edit]**"

33:43 _No Matter What_ by Badfinger

33:59 George: "And I produced Doris Troy, and I produced a record by Jackie Lomax."

34:04 _Sour Milk Sea_ by Jackie Lomax.

34:10 Neil Aspinall: "Mary Hopkins _[sic]_ came from the Huey Green, y'know, whatever his show was called."

34:27 Paul: "Opportunity Knocks."

34:28 _Goodbye_ by Mary Hopkin

34:40 Neil Aspinall: "It might have been exciting for everybody else, and for people that came in from the outside. For me, it was a lot of hard work setting it up and a lot of chaos."

35:01 Paul: "We were just guys goofing off, having a lot of fun, trying to get things under our control," up to George: "The only thing we could do was write songs and make records and be Beatles. **[edit]**"

35:29 Opening of _Yellow Submarine_ movie up to Paul: "I think seeing it now is pretty good. Y'know, it's quite interesting really."

36:45 Ringo: "Oh no, I love the film, I thought it was really innovative, it's great animation. Sea of Holes still to this day holds up, the Blue Meanie Syndrome."

36:54 Clip: "Anti-music missiles?"

37:12 George: "Yeah, I like the film, I think it's a classic film," up to "I think it suits it."

37:39 Clip: "Yes deh do look very nice, don't dey?"

37:50 Paul: (exaggerated Scouse accent) "But that's where all of that stuff came from, y'know, that sort of terrible fake Liverpool accent, hello."

38:01 Ringo: "The thing with that film that still blows me away is that..." up to John: "So then I decided to see the rest of the show and that's when we met."

41:29 John: "The naked album cover **[edit]** that was the one of the first things we did."

41:42 Ringo: "They showed me this cover..." up to "Well, Ring, you only have to answer the phone, so okay, fine."

42:14 John: "**[edit]** We felt like two virgins, that's what the album was called, because we were in love, just met and we were trying to make something."

42:22 Paul: "She and John had kind of a very intense romance, y'know, when they got together, and she being kind of a conceptual artist, y'know, he was fascinated by all that, she's a very strong woman, a very independent woman, and John, I think, always liked strong women."

42:39 George: "They were, from that point on, never to be seen without each other, y'know, for the next few years, at least."

42:48 John: "Everybody seemed to be paranoid except for us..." up to: "We just happened to be, want to be together all the time."

43:08 Paul: "Trouble was, for us, it encroached on our framework..." up to Ringo: "And that's how they started to live, every moment together, **which was something Barbara and I took up when we got married. We were absolutely, moment by moment, we were together.**"

44:05 _Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da_ and _Good Night_, early takes and studio chatter.

44:51 Ringo: "Of course I did have moments of turmoil on the white album, because I left, I left the group."

44:57 _Blackbird_, Paul in Studio 2, watched by Francie Schwartz.

45:15 George: "**During that period, I think everybody was getting cheesed off, but yeah, Ringo did leave, I can't remember exactly why. I just remember he was,** suddenly one day, I think Neil or somebody said, 'Oh, Ringo's gone on holiday.'"

45:29 Ringo: "I felt two things, I felt I wasn't playing great..." up to "I thought it was you three."

46:22 Paul: "**[edit]** I mean, y'know, that's what he's like in life," up to "I think he was pleased to hear that."

46:49 Ringo: "And I came back and went in the studio and George had had decked out with flowers..." up to "and we'd got through that little crisis."

47:10 Studio chatter

47:18 Ringo: "**[edit]** And I knew we were just in a messed up stage, all of us then, y'know, it wasn't just me, it was, the whole thing was going down."

47:26 _Rocky Racoon_ brief out-take

47:33 Paul: "I think it's a very good album myself, I think it stood up, but it wasn't a pleasant one to make. But again, y'know, sometimes those things work for your art."

47:42 _Helter Skelter_ excerpt

47:52 Ringo: "Helter Skelter is just a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio. Y'know, sometimes you just have to shake out the jams."

48:01 Paul: "We just tried to get it louder, guitars, can't we have them sound louder, the drums louder. And that was really all I wanted to do, make a very loud, raunchy rock and roll record with the Beatles, which it is."

48:17 Paul: "We did it so long and so often that on the end of it Ringo did have blisters. I think at the end of some take you can hear him, 'I've got blisters on me hands.'"

48:27 Paul's recollection is corrected by the appropriate clip

48:55 George: "There was a lot more individual stuff for the first time..." up to "... maybe they'd set a release date and time was running out."

49:25 Extensive new studio chatter, including the infamous "It's no point in Mr. Martin being uptight."

51:15 George: "We always try to make things different. And I think things were always different anyway because, y'know, just in a matter of months we'd changed in so many ways, y'know. So there was no chance of it ever being, y'know, like the previous record. And all the experience that had happened in India and stuff since Sergeant Pepper was all embodied in that album."

51:39 _Yer Blues_

51:48 John: "I wasn't interested in following up Sergeant Pepper. And I don't know whether the others were or not. But I know that what I was going for was to forget about Sergeant Pepper. Y'know, that was Sergeant Pepper and that's all right, fine, it's over, and just get back to basic music."

52:03 _Back in the U.S.S.R._

52:03 Ringo: "Sergeant Pepper did its thing, it was the album of the decade, of the century maybe. It was very innovative, great songs, I'm glad I was on it. But the White album, we ended up being more of a band again. And that's what I always love, I love being in a band."

52:25 _Why Don't We Do It in the Road_

52:25 George: "It became apparent that there was more songs than would make a single album."

52:40 Paul: "I think it's a fine little album and I think the fact that it's got so much on it is one of the things that's cool about it."

52:45 John: "The songs, and most of it, it's just as good as anything we recorded."

52:48 Ringo: "And there was lots of group activity going down. I love the White album."

53:06 George Martin: "When they did the White album, I thought we should have made probably a very, very good single album out of it, rather than making a double album."

53:14 Ringo: "Well, no, I agree, we should have put it out as two separate albums, the White and the Whiter Album..." up to George: "... elbowed or made into b-sides."

53:45 Paul: "**[edit]** I think it's a fine little album..." up to "... it's the bloody Beatles' White Album, shut up!"

54:09 _Revolution_ promo film, interrupted multiple times by remarks below.

55:40 George: "We were outspoken. Y'know, the Cromwell kind of figures in the establishment were trying to get their own back on us. Brian Epstein died, so they tried to say, 'OK, well, everything they've done since he died is crap.' Y'know, just the typical kind of silly stuff, [like everything goes in a cycle. And once it starts going down, as anybody can tell you, y'know, when you get knocked to the ground, then they start kicking you, y'know.](#8&dvd13) _[Moved from Episode 8 in DVD]_ And that's the kind of thing that happened."

56:16 Paul: "The world was a problem, but we weren't. Y'know, that was the best thing about The Beatles. Until we started to break up, some, like, White Album and stuff, then even the studio got a bit tense then." [Also moved from Episode 8 in DVD](#8&dvd14)

56:27 John: "We broke up then, we made the double album. That was the disintegration."

56:38 Ringo: "Y'know, it's like the wind down to a divorce. Y'know, a divorce usually doesn't just happen, y'know. There's months and years of misery." [Also moved from Episode 8 in DVD](#8&dvd16)

56:48 _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, acoustic demo, over end credits.
