12:40 Neil Aspinall: "The Apple boutique closed down, yeah, I, thinking about that one, I just, I just don't, I think we got to the point where we didn't want it any more."

12:56 Ringo: "Well, because we ended up selling the Marks and Spencers underwear, and it's not the image we started with we started with, y'know, Simon and Marijke and all this colourful clothes, and y'know, great 60s hippie gear, and then y'know. to make it pay we ended up selling St Michael underwear, and it wasn't the image we wanted."

13:21 John: "We came up the idea to give it all away and stop fucking about with a psychedelic clothes shop, so we gave it all away."

13:29 Paul: "We just gave it to the people who showed up on the day, and you could have one item each and then you mustn't take two, in the spirit of the thing. Well, they cleaned out the shop. But I think personally it was a good way to do it because it showed we weren't really seriously trying to, sort of, be in the rag trade. It was like, look, didn't work, so."

13:52 Neil Aspinall: "That's it, y'know, and, we all went around the night before we gave everything away, y'know, and uh took what we felt we we wanted, y'know."

14:05 Derek Taylor: "I didn't go there and I had a half acquaintance I saw outside Apple. I said 'Where you going?' He said, 'Oh I'm off to the shop, I'm going to join the queue to get some of those clothes.' I thought that was awful, and I didn't want to close the shop, and I wrote an impassioned open letter, dear boys, y'know, if you do this and that about the der-der, because I dreaded to see the thing falling apart."

14:34 _Frost On Sunday_ theme tune, impromptu performance by the Beatles, as David Frost attempts to shut them up by smiling.

14:48 David Frost: "Beautiful _[John picks out the theme on his guitar with comic awkwardness]_ Poetry. Beautiful, absolute poetry. Welcome back to part three, as you can see, with the greatest tea room orchestra in the world. _[the band strikes up again]_ Beautiful. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful."

15:17 George: "Are you in colour?"

15:18 David Frost: "No, we're in black and white at this very moment I'm afraid, but as you can see making their first audience appearance for over a year, ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles, thank you very much."

15:32 Paul: "I was driving out to John's house after John and Cynthia had got divorced..." up to "... sometimes get a little emotional during that moment, y'know?"

17:03 _Hey Jude_ on David Frost, complete song, with the comments below occurring as voice over during the long ending.

20:11 George: "this was the period when y'know everything was going up and up and up and rosy and then suddenly it reached that point and it started to go down, [like everything goes in a cycle. And once it starts going down, as anybody can tell you, y'know, when you get knocked to the ground, then they start kicking you, y'know.](#7&dplus117)" _The preceding quote has moved to Episode 7 in Disney+_

20:50 Paul: "The world was a problem but we weren't y'know that was the best thing about the Beatles until we started to break up so like white album and stuff then it even the studio got a bit tense then." [Also moved to Episode 7 in Disney+](#7&dplus118)

21:07 John: "It was evident on the white album y'know I think it was evident in India when George and I stayed there Paul and Ringo left and it was a slow death."

22:36 Ringo: "Y'know it's like the wind down to a divorce y'know a divorce usually doesn't just happen, y'know there's months and years of misery." [Also moved to Episode 7 in Disney+](#7&dplus120)"

23:03 George Martin: "They were going through a very revolutionary period at that time..." up to "And we started rehearsing down in Twickenham Film Studios and I went along with them."

23:30 Neil Aspinall: "I'm not sure whether everybody was behind the idea of going to Twickenham. I think what they decided to do was film whatever they were doing and they were going to start making a new album."

23:41 Paul: "The original idea was that you'd see the Beatles rehearsing, jamming" up to "Michael Lindsay-Hogg was going to direct it."

24:04 Clip from Twickenham, not included in _Let it Be_ nor _Get Back_, in which Paul explains to his director how tracking shots work, then a run-through of _I've Got a Feeling_.

25:28 George: "I thought, okay, y'know, it's a new year and we got some new approach but it soon became apparent that it wasn't anything new, it was just, it was just going to be painful again."

25:51 Ringo: "I mean, y'know, the days were long and it could get boring, y'know, and Twickenham just wasn't really conducive to any great atmosphere, it was just in a big barn."

26:03 George: "I'd just spent like the last six months producing an album of this fellow Jackie Lomax and hanging out with Bob Dylan and the band in Woodstock and having a great time and for me to come back into the winter of discontent with the Beatles in Twickenham was, it was very unhealthy and unhappy."

26:25 John: "It was just dreadful, dreadful feeling and being filmed all the time" up to George: "I'm not able to be happy in this situation, y'know, I'm getting out of here."

28:35 John: "The whole pressure of it finally got to us" up to Ringo: "... there was many discussions going on by then, many heated discussions."

32:54 George Martin: "Billy Preston was a great help, he was a very good keyboard guy **and I mean his work on _Get Back_ alone justified him being there and** he was an amiable fellow too, very nice and he was a kind of, yes he was a kind of emollient if you like, he helped to lubricate the friction that had been there."

33:12 George: "It's interesting to see how people behave nicely when you bring a guest in because they don't really want everybody to know that they're so bitchy, and this happened back in the White album when I brought Eric Clapton in to play on _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, suddenly everybody's on their best behaviour. So I put a message out to find if Billy was in town and told him to come in to Savile Row, which he did. Straight away, just became 100% improvement in the vibe in the room **and everybody was happier also to have somebody else playing in the band.**"

33:50 Clip of John explaining to Billy that they're working without overdubs, dialogue is just audible, one camera angle.

34:00 Ringo: "**We were working on a good track and that always excited us and his part was also a part of it.** Suddenly, when we were working on something good, the bullshit went out the window and we got back down to doing what we did really, really well."

34:17 Group discussion about where to put the guitar solo in _Get Back_, George's comments are barely audible.

35:08 Paul: "To me, the Beatles were always a great little band," up to "... it seemed to work, it seemed to gel."

35:55 _The Long and Winding Road_, complete song.

39:23 George: "The idea being that we were going to, originally we were going to rehearse all these new songs..." up to Paul: "And we said, 'Well, that's an end, 'Beatle's busted on rooftop gig.'" Includes roof-top performance of _Don't Let Me Down_.

45:14 Ringo: "The thing on the roof that always I feel let down about with the police," up to "So it could have been fabulous."

45:42 _Get Back_, roof-top performance.

48:14 John: "By the time we got to Let It Be, we couldn't play the game any more, we couldn't do it any more. It had come to a point where it was no longer creating magic, and the camera sort of, being in the room with us made us aware of that, that it was a phony situation."

48:27 Paul: "In fact, what happened was when we got in there, we showed how the break-up of a group works. We didn't realise that we were actually sort of breaking up, y'know, as it was happening."

48:38 George: "Just the same as it was before, y'know, the year before, when we were last in the studio. It was a lot of kind of trivia and games that were being played."

48:53 Ringo: "**Well, I think it shows as an absolute fact that we were going different places, y'know. Y'know, I've mentioned it before,** but the energy for the Beatles was waning. Y'know, we put in a thousand percent and then it was dwindling now. It's like, oh, dear, do we have to turn up? Do we have to do that thing again? I want to do this and John wants to do that. Y'know, George was off and, y'know, people would, y'know, we had families."

49:21 Paul: "And I remember thinking of it like army buddies..." up to "We always knew that day had to come."

49:58 _Let It Be_, complete song.

53:45 Bob Danvers-Walker for [Pathe News](https://www.britishpathe.com/asset/89312/) on Paul and Linda's "plans for a quiet wedding."

54:41 George: "And they chose Paul's wedding day to bust me."

54:46 Neil Aspinall: "Really? Oh, because George was in my office and Patty rang saying that [Sergeant Pilcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Pilcher), if that was his name, was swarming all over the house in Esher. And George said to me, 'What should I do? What should I tell Patty about this conversation?' And I said, 'Well, have you got any stuff to just tell them where it is, George, 'cause they'll find it anyway.' Y'know? Save yourself a lot of hassles, y'know? And he said, 'Well, he had a bit of grass, maybe a bit of hash in a box on the mantelpiece.' Right? So he rang Patty and told her to tell him where it was, y'know? By which time they'd found a chunk this big in a boot in his wardrobe."

55:34 Ringo: "Y'know, Sergeant Pilcher was gaining great notoriety of just busting pop stars, y'know, besides George and Mick and Keith and John, and always was the same cop. Nobody really, y'know, nobody put two and two together."

55:49 George: "What happened was there was the kind of social or pecking order that was in the pop world, and the drug squad decided to go around, I mean, this fella thought he was Oliver Cromwell, so he decided to go around and clean up what was going on, and they busted Donovan first. Y'know, anybody who was in England at that time will remember. They bust Donovan, and then they bust the Rolling Stones, and they worked their way up, and then they busted John and Yoko and me."

56:23 Documentary clip about Norman Pilcher's conviction for perjury.

56:48 John: "But now my life has changed in oh so many ways. A wop bop-a-looma, alim bam boo."

56:58 John: "We wanted to get married on the cross-channel ferry..." up to "... and we went there and it was beautiful."

57:23 _The Ballad of John and Yoko_, from the line that mentions Peter Brown, to the end.

59:35 Paul: "When John hooked up with Yoko so intensely, that was obviously, it was kind of obvious that there could be no looking back after that. I always felt that he had to clear the decks of us in order to give her enough attention.

59:59 John: "It takes a lot to live with four people over and over for years and years, which is what we did. And we'd call each other every name under the sun, we'd got to blows, we'd been through the whole damn show."

01:00:12 John: "We knew where we were at, we still do. We'd been through the mill together for more than ten years. We've been through our therapy together many times, y'know."

01:00:25 Ringo: "Y'know, in a lot of days, even with all the craziness, it really worked still. Instead of working every day, it worked like two days a month, y'know. There were still good days. We were still really close friends, y'know. Then it would split off again into some madness."

01:00:44 George: "Y'know, it was quite obvious that the Beatles became, y'know, I mean, the thing that it started out being, it gave us a vehicle to be able to do so much when we were younger and we grew right through that. But it got to a point where it was stifling us. There was too much restriction, y'know. It had to self-destruct."

01:01:06 John: "It's easy after the fact, y'know, people were saying about Apple and the Beatles' business..." up to Neil Aspinall: "... Alan Klein had the opportunity to come in and say he could do it, but so did a lot of other people."

01:02:09 George: "Klein had been managing the Rolling Stones, and I believe Donovan..." up to John: "I make a lot of mistakes character-wise, y'know? But now then, I make a good one, y'know?"

01:02:41 Neil Aspinall: "The alternative to Klein, really, was possibly Lee Eastman, y'know? But I'm not at all sure that, y'know, Paul wanted Lee Eastman to be a manager in the sense that, y'know, Brian Epstein had been a manager. Or Alan Klein to be a manager in the sense of Brian Epstein being a manager."

01:03:05 Paul: "I'd put forward Lee Eastman, Linda's dad, as possible sort of lawyer..." up to "... so the three to one thing was very awkward."

01:03:46 Paul: "And things would happen like I remember being at Olympic Studio one evening, and we were supposed to be doing something on Abbey Road, I think. And the three guys showed up, we all showed up at the studio ready to record, and Alan Klein showed up as part of the party with this sort of henchman. And they said, you've got to sign a contract for Klein. He's got to take it to his board. I said, it's Friday night. No, he doesn't work on a Saturday. Anyway, Alan Klein's alluring to himself. He hasn't got a board he has to report to, y'know. I said, don't worry. So we could easily do this on Monday. Let's do our session now. You're not going to push me into this, y'know. They said, oh, you're stalling. They said he wants 15%, he wants 20%. I said, tell him he can have 15%. They said, you're stalling. And I said, no, I'm working for us. We're a big act. I remember the exact words, we're a big act. The Beatles, he'll take 15%. But for some strange reason, I think they were so intoxicated with him that they said, no, he's got to have 20%. And he's got to report to his board tomorrow. You've got to sign now or never, kind of thing. I said, right, I said, well, I'm not signing now. It was a big argument. And they all went, leaving me at the studio.

01:04:58 Neil Aspinall: "What changed at Apple after he arrived, everything. It was a completely different situation. Number one, right, first and foremost, Paul wasn't there."

01:05:10 George Martin: "At the end of Let It Be, Let It Be was such an unhappy record, really, even though there were some great songs on it, I really thought that was the end of the Beatles and I thought I would never work with them again. I thought what a shame to go out there like this."

01:05:26 George Martin: "So I was quite surprised when Paul rang me up..." up to "... and let's get together again. **And it was a very happy record. I guess it was happy because everybody knew it was going to be the last.**"

01:05:52 George: "Well I think the deal was that, y'know, through Let It Be it was like, we, I left, and we got back on the basis that we've got to just finish it up, make it tidy. So I got back on that basis, then everybody decided, well, we ought to do one better album."

01:06:10 Ringo: "**I think it shows on the record that when we were excited, the track's exciting, y'know? It's really-- all comes together.** It doesn't matter what we're going through as individuals, y'know, on the bullshit level. When it gets to the music, y'know, when you can see that it's really cool, we all put in the 1,000%."

01:06:33 _Something_ promo film

01:09:13 George Martin: "**Nobody knew for sure it was going to be the last one, but everybody felt it was, y'know. I think the Beatles have gone through so much, and it was a long time. I mean, incarcerated with each other for nearly a decade, and** it was a very, very happy album. Everybody worked frightfully well, and that's why I'm very fond of it."

01:09:51 Ringo: "It was always a possibility that we could have carried on. We weren't sitting in the studio saying, OK, this is it. Last record, last track, last take."

01:10:05 George: "But I think at the point we'd finished Abbey Road, it was really-- the game was up, y'know, and I think we all accepted that."

01:10:43 _Octopus's Garden_

01:11:04 _Here Comes the Sun_

01:11:30 _Come Together_

01:12:01 _Ringo_: "It was magical. There were some really loving, caring moments between four people. **A hotel room here and there.** A really amazing closeness. Four guys who really loved each other Was pretty sensational."

01:12:39 George: "Y'know, they gave their money and they gave their screams..." up to Paul: "There's a very good spirit behind it all."

01:13:18 John: "It's just natural. It's not a great disaster. People keep talking about it as if it's the end of the earth. It's only a rock group that split up. It's nothing important. Y'know, you have all the old records there if you want to reminisce."

01:14:04 (The Threetles round-table) Paul: "I mean, that's what they ask when you go around the world on those tours, y'know, and this other press comes as well. 'Are you getting the Beatles back together again?', they say, 'What are you talking about?' We couldn't. They say, 'Well, how about Julian?' I say, 'I feel sorry for him getting in the middle of all of that.' Or Sean or somebody, y'know."

01:14:26 George: "Sean."

01:14:27 Ringo: "Well, let me ask you it this way. Are you getting back together?"

01:14:29 Paul: "No. And yet, with three as a bird, we somehow did."
