00:30 Ed Sullivan introduces the Beatles at Shea Stadium, _Twist and Shout_. As usual the picture is enhanced but the most striking change is to the soundtrack. During the song performances the screaming has been removed entirely, and between numbers there is far less high-frequency hysteria.

02:56 Paul: "It was the baseball stadium's P.A., we were just working off the normal columns, which were _[mimes speaking through a loud hailer]_ 'Ladies and gentlemen, the next player is...' y'know, and our stuff is coming out of there. So it can't've sounded too good."

03:08 George: "Vox made a special big amplifiers for that tour, and they were like 100 watts. We went up from the 30 watt amp to the 100 watt amp."

03:21 Neil Aspinall: "Yeah, that was mic'd up, I think, to the big speakers that they had around Shea Stadium. So the audience weren't necessarily listening to what was coming from the stage. They were listening to what was coming from the PA system, really."

03:35 John introduces _Baby's In Black_ with some gibberish. The pitch invader is edited out. After the song, up to Ringo: "I mean, I feel that on that show, John cracked up. I mean, just went mad, not mentally ill, I mean, just got crazy."

07:05 John: "We did _I'm Down,_ because I did the organ on the record... I was doing it for a laugh." Slowed-down footage of him playing the organ at Shea Stadium, but now in colour and treated to seem like high-framerate slow-motion.

07:18 _I'm Down_, up to Paul: "I mean, now it's a kind of a big crowd, even, 56,000."

09:59 Ringo: "You know, 60,000 people."

10:01 George: "Told me it was 70."

10:04 _Help_, starting after the first verse. The subsequent commentary is over the second verse and then again shortly before the end of the second chorus, so none of the verses are heard.

10:23 George: "It was like we felt totally isolated from the crowd, and it was like we were just playing to ourselves, even though you could see these flash bulbs going off, and hear this screeching going on in the distance."

10:36 John: "It was a great experience, you know, I mean, it was just incredible, the first one, you know, all that just happening going on, you know, you'd be yelling and shouting."

10:56 John: "For us, it was just a drag, you know, we knew that they wouldn't hear anything, because it's just, you know, like a riot and not sort of like a show, you know."

11:05 Paul: "I personally, as I say, I don't really think it was that bad."

11:08 Paul: "We're now a big band that when we went, 'Woo!' and shook our heads, everyone went mad."

11:14 John: "It got a little boring. I mean, it was great when it first happened, when you'd come on, there'd just be nothing but 'Wah!', y'know?"

11:34 Ringo: "The realisation, you know, is really kicking in that nobody was listening. And that was OK at the beginning. But even worse than that is we were playing so bad."

11:44 John: "We just became, like, lip-syncing, you know? Miming. And we didn't... We almost... Sometimes things would break down and nobody would know. And so it wasn't... It wasn't doing the music any good."

11:57 Ringo: "And, you know, why I joined the Beatles was because they were the best band in Liverpool. And I always wanted to play with good players. That's what it was all about, you see? First and foremost, we were musicians."

12:15 George Martin: "They'd shared no signs of flagging as far as their musical creativity was concerned. On the contrary, they were becoming more and more productive and the work they were giving me was much more interesting. They were finding new frontiers all the time **and their success gave them confidence to do things which they wouldn't dare do before.**"

12:38 _Drive My Car_ excerpt

12:51 Paul: "And other people were starting to arrive on the scene that were a little bit influential. And I don't know really whether we'd been influenced. I think Dylan was starting to influence us quite heavily at that point."

13:03 John: "When it got sort of contemporary, as it were, even if it was contemporary influence, I think _Rubber Soul_ was about when it started happening."

13:13 John: "_Rubber Soul_ really was a matter of having all experienced the recording studio, having grown musically as well, but mainly having experienced the studio and knowing the possibilities."

13:22 _Girl_ excerpt

13:27 George: "We were getting more fine-tuned, really. More of the same, but fine-tuning it. And, I mean, we certainly knew we were making a good album then."

13:40 Studio chatter

13:47 _If I Needed Someone_ excerpt

13:59 Paul: "We always wanted every single record to have a different sound. We never wanted to get trapped in this 'The Mersey Beat.'"

14:04 More studio chatter from a _Norwegian Wood_ session

14:12 Paul: "It was just around that period when we were all getting into various different kinds of music and George's became Indian. I think all of us were listening to sort of classical and various types of music other than our own and our rock-and-roll kind of roots. And George just sort of moved into the Indian thing. I think he'd give you a better explanation of just sort of when it was."

14:38 George: "**[edit]** During that year, towards the end of that year anyway, I kept hearing the name of Ravi Shankar," up to "We just miked it up, and we put it on, and it just seemed to hit the spot."

16:16 _Norwegian Wood_ excerpt

16:31 George Martin: "They were getting more and more interested in unusual sounds, and, yes, I mean, they were trying out new instruments and always coming to me, saying, 'What ideas have you got for this?'"

16:45 John: "Well, we'd be saying, 'What can we do? We're only going ooh-ooh and eeh-eeh.' And he'd say, 'Well look, chaps, I thought of this this afternoon,' and we'd say, 'Oh, great!'

16:53 George Martin: "And Rubber Soul was an indication of the way things were going to go. It's one of my favourite albums. I think it's a great album."

16:59 Ringo: "Our whole attitude was changing. We'd grown up a little, I think grass was really influential in a lot of our changes. Especially with the writers, you know, so because they were writing different stuff, we were playing differently. **[edit]**"

17:22 _I'm Looking Through You_ clip

17:27 Paul: "The title, Rubber Soul, was kind of, hey, man, it's got soul. It's a lot of soul, a lot of soul, that music. It was a spoof on that, you know. Seemed nice and amusing. Very us, you know, very wacky."

17:41 Paul: (in a studio out-take) "Plastic soul, man. Plastic soul."

17:43 _Drive My Car_ ending clip

17:54 George: "I don't see too much difference myself in _Rubber Soul_ and _Revolver_. To me, they could both be like volume one and volume two. **[edit]** They both were very pleasant and enjoyable records for me."

18:32 Ringo: We were having more fun in the studio from _Revolver,_ _Rubber Soul_, as it was building up, it was getting more experimental. The songs were getting better, more interesting. So that's where we were going.

18:44 Studio chatter from _Eleanor Rigby_ string section recording session

19:00 George Martin: "And their ideas now were beginning to become much more potent in the studio and they would start telling me what they wanted, and they would start pressing me for more ideas. **[edit]**"

19:11 John: "He'd come up with things like, 'Well, have you heard an oboe?' 'No, which one's that? 'It's this one.' 'That would be nice.' So it was really, we grew together."

19:19 More out-take chatter

19:37 Paul: "And one day, a tape-op got a tape on backwards. He went to play it, and it's... _[mimics backward tape sound, not as well as John]_ Bloody hell, sounds Indian!"

19:50 Ringo: "We'd be well into the album, and we all knew that, you know, I'd be doing a number somewhere. It's just about three quarters of the way through, so we'd either say, 'Have you got a song, you know, we've got this for you.'"

20:09 John's home demo, "In the place where I was born, no one cared, no one cared."

20:25 Ringo: "Well, like all the tracks I did in those days, it was written by Paul and John."

20:30 Studio out take chatter leading into John and Paul demoing _Yellow Submarine_ together.

20:48 Ringo: "I actually don't know where they got the idea for it from."

20:52 Paul: "**[edit]** I just remember lying in bed, just that moment before you're going to sleep, that little twilight moment, when silly ideas come into your head anyway. And then I just thought of this thing, _Yellow Submarine_, yeah, you know."

21:05 _Yellow Submarine_ over purely the home movies of the Beatles on vacation, no animated characters survive

21:55 Ringo: "By then I'd started writing myself," up to George: "... a heavy penalty to pay for making money."

23:49 Paul: "And, you know, they say, 'Look, when you're dead, you're going to pay taxes.' And I remember that. 'What? You can't even...' You know, 'Now, death duties, what?' And so, you know, he came up with that great thing, 'They tax the pennies on your eyes.'"

24:21 George Martin: "And it was on Revolver that, of course, we have the track _Tomorrow Never Knows_, which was a great innovation."

24:28 John: "That's me and my Tibetan book of the dead period. And the expression _Tomorrow Never Knows_ was another of Ringo's malapropisms, which was like _Hard Day's Night_. And so I gave it a throwaway title because I was a bit self-conscious about the heavy philosophical lyrics of _Tomorrow Never Knows_." **[This is a complex splicing together of small phrases]**

24:44 Paul: "John had this song which was all on the chord of C... Suddenly this was just John just strumming on C rather earnestly. **[edit]**"

25:08 _Tomorrow Never Knows_, up to _Nowhere Man_ live in Munich, interrupted just before the guitar solo.

27:16 George: "Somewhere between albums and tours there was a day where I had a dentist... And then before you knew where you were suddenly it was all crazy."

29:51 Paul: "But I really was frightened of that kind of stuff... and I think John was rather excited by that prospect. I was rather frightened by that prospect. **[edit]**"

30:17 _Day Tripper_ begins

30:44 Paul: "So I delayed and I was seen to sort of stall a little bit, I think, within the group, you know, 'cause there was a lot of peer pressure. I mean talk about peer pressure - the Beatles."

30:52 _Day Tripper_ continues, using footage from a single TV lip-sync appearance.

31:17 Brian Matthews: "Seeing as how this show's the last Saturday Club..." up to "I'm putting it on now and here goes the needle on the record."

32:43 _We Can Work It Out_, partial, using a single lip-sync performance (black roll-neck sweaters).

33:20 George: "Well, the mania, you know, was, as we've talked about, was pretty difficult to get around..." up to Ringo in the clip for Ed Sullivan: "And one's called _Rain_ and one's called _Paperback Writer_."

35:22 _Paperback Writer_ over the promo film, truncated.

36:10 George: "So I mean that was the idea. We'd send them to America also because we thought well we can't go everywhere. We'll send these things out to promote the record. And obviously like these days now everybody does that. It's just part of your promotion for a single. So I suppose in a way we invented MTV."

36:32 _Rain_ promo, interrupted by new John voice over.

37:17 John: "I made the basic track. I would take a seven and a half rough mix home. I was so stoned out my mind on marijuana that I'd get back to the house, and as I usually do, I listen to immediately what I've done that day. I put it on, somehow I got it on backwards, and I sat there trying to speak with the earphones on the big hash joint, just listening, and the whole thing was backwards."

37:39 John: "That's the first record with backwards music on it. **Before Hendrix, before The Who, before any fucker.**" _(Subtitle for the next part says "John's vocal playing backwards", but of course it is in fact John in the interview doing an excellent impersonation of a tape playing backwards.)_

38:04 _Got To Get You Into My Life_ begins

38:45 Paul: "We were locked up in the hotel for a long time with various merchants coming around..." up to George: "At 5.35 we'll be down in the car park."

39:50 Paul: "So as we went to the gig, they had the fans organised with police patrols on each corner..." up to the Budokan concert introduction.

41:36 _Rock and Roll Music_, live at the Budokan, a section edited out of the middle.

42:31 Paul: "The close harmonies on things like _Paperback Writer_..." up to George: "You know, there was way of doing it on stage, really."

43:21 _Paperback Writer_, live at the Budokan, seven second clip of the chorus.

43:28 George: "We'd get to the point where it was particularly bad... the screaming did cover a lot of worrying moments."

43:45 Neil Aspinall: "Yeah, the scream used to cover a multitude of sins, right? And now, at those shows, it wasn't there. **For the first time in a long time, the audience were listening. There was no big scream. It came as a bit of a surprise because, you know, everybody suddenly realized they were out of tune or singing out - you know, they had to get their act together.**"

44:25 _Yesterday_, live at the Budokan, excerpt.

44:53 George: "This is a thing which we never really talked about, but everywhere we were going in these days it was a demonstration of one thing or another, it was, you know, riots were happening. Plus people were demonstrating because the Budokan was supposed to be a special spiritual hall and only reserved for martial arts."

45:15 Reporter at news conference: "Some Japanese say that your performances will violate the Budokan, which is devoted to traditional Japanese martial arts, and you've set a bad example for Japanese youth by leading them astray from traditional Japanese values. What do you think of all that?"

45:31 Paul: "The thing is that if somebody from Japan, if a dancing troupe from Japan goes to Britain, nobody tries to say in Britain that they're violating the traditional laws,
y'know, or trying to spoil anything. All we're doing is coming here and singing because we've been asked to."

45:46 John: "It's better to watch singing than wrestling anyway."

45:49 George: "I don't know what martial arts has got to do with spirituality, but maybe it does. But, you know, I mean, only violence and spirituality, but not pop music."

45:58 Ringo: "You know, in any town we went to, someone always had a grievance. Something was wrong."

46:04 **Instead of being briefly trailed here, the Philippines sequence is included at this point, but with some lengthy commentary removed.** _(will be detailed in Episode 6)_

51:46 George Martin: "When they got out of their country, they said, never again, You know, this is it. And they said to Brian then, they would not tour again. Brian said, 'Sorry, lads, we've got something fixed up for the Shea Stadium.' 'Cancel it.' 'I can't cancel it.' 'You've got to cancel it. We're not doing it anymore.' And he said, 'Well, if we cancel it, you're going to lose a million dollars'. Whoops."

01:09:10 _And Your Bird Can Sing_ alternate take over end credits
