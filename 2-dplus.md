Anthology, 2025 Disney+ Version: Episode 2

00:53 Paul: "Probably the thing that John and I will do, will be write songs, as we have been doing, as a sort of sideline now. We'll probably develop that a bit more."

01:03 George Martin: "**[edit]** But before they showed evidence of that, I still had to have an album out, and so what I did was, I mean, I'd been up to the Cavern and I'd seen what they could do, I knew their repertoire, I knew what they were able to perform, _[cut to still photos, GM continues in VO]_ and I said 'Let's record every song you've got. Come down to the studio and we'll just whistle through them in a day.'"

01:21 Studio chatter, "Don't be nervous John," "I'm not nervous"

01:32 Montage of snippets from finished LP over contemporary photos/footage, but much digital clean-up

01:50 Ringo: "But we knew those songs, you see, because that was the act we did all over the country."

02:09 John: "Rock and roll was brand new, when it came out, and excited everybody, it had roots in blues and jazz. But you can't say that rock and roll is like the Twenties music, although if you look for it, you can find out where it came from. And you can find out where Beatles music came from, or any music came from. Like, it has its history.

02:30 George Martin: They were always very influenced by American rhythm and blues. I think this is probably what the so-called Beatle sound was, because maybe they heard the records before we did. But they knew much more about Motown and all the Black music, much more about it than anybody else did, and that was a tremendous influence on them.

02:50 John: "And the Beatles just carried it a bit futher, made it a little more White, even than Elvis did, because we were English, y'know?

02:58 Studio chatter, "I can 'ardly strum..."

03:03 Montage continues

03:17 George: "And we'd all say, what about this, and what about this? 'Cause basically this album is just what we did live, in the clubs."

03:23 Studio chatter, "Shall we just do it on the second verse..."

03:31 _Do You Want to Know a Secret_

03:42 John: "The first album was recorded in a, one long 12-hour session, which, the last song to be done was a song called _Twist and Shout_, which nearly killed me. You can hear that I'm some frantic guy, y'know, doing his best, it's about the nearest it could get to knowing what we sounded like before we became the clever Beatles."

03:31 _Twist and Shout_ cutting between mixed footage

04:10 Paul: "John had to save _Twist and Shout_ till the last, and he was sucking Zubes all day, little throat tablets, and he finally had to do _Twist and Shout_, he had to do it last because it would just rip his throat apart to do it. It was great. You can still hear that on the record."

03:31 _Twist and Shout_ continues to the end of the track

06:27 George Martin: "We started at 10 o'clock in the morning, finished at 11 at night. And that was the record made."

06:32 Studio chatter, "That's it, that's the master."

06:34 Neil Aspinall: "When we used to tour, do those Arthur Howe touring shows..." up to George: "actually closing the first half of the show."

07:52 John: "[We were performers in Liverpool, Hamburg and round the dance halls, y'know, and what we generated was fantastic](#1&dvd102). **And there was nobody to touch us in Britain.**" (Moved from Episode 1)

08:02 _There's a Place_ (gig locations fly up the screen as newly-rendered faux road signs), up to _It Won't Be Long_ montage of home movies during early tours, ending 12:42.

12:43 Paul: "One of the things I was grateful for was, we had a kind of staircase to climb".

12:48 Paul: "... through clubs like the Cavern, through, up to ballrooms, which were now instead of 400, 500 people, it was now a couple of thousand people."

12:58 Paul: "Then it was like, well, what's left? Well, radio..." up to Saturday Club, John "Greeting everybody with a smile" and Brian Matthew, "Thank you, dear Beatles". at 14:49. Only minor edits to shorten the montage of BBC tracks.

15:00 Derek Taylor, up to Ringo's Salmon out of tin until he was 22, ends 18:12 - only change being the usual de-Joolsing.

18:09 John: "In the early days we'd make a record in 12 hours..." up to Brian Matthew's on "three number ones in a row for the Liverpool boys" ending 19:10

19:11 _She Loves You_ live concert performance at ABC Cinema Manchester, completely re-scanned in widescreen, also playback speed slowed down compared to DVD. Ending 21:34, omitting the dramatic reverbed screaming audience member.

21:35 Ringo: "When we go home, we go in early in the morning, when we've finished the job, and the kids, y'know, they don't know you're at home. But if they find out, well, where I live, they get the drums out, and beat it out... It was getting really big, I think we noticed as we tried to move around town, we started, y'know, being noticed in the street."

22:03 Ringo: "It was impossible to go home. And also, it's very true, if you're in our business, you go to London,.." up to John's "We were very close to the Stones." at 23:11. _(Some Jools noised removed during Ringo anecdote.)_

23:12 John: "They needed a record, they'd put out _Come On_ by Chuck Berry and they needed a quick follow-up. _I Wanna Be Your Man_, which we virtually finished off in front of them." _(an edit job on the original clip, switching phrases around)_

23:22 _I Wanna Be Your Man_ (Rolling Stones, live TV performance) up to the end of the same song performed by The Beatles, except George speaks over the ending.

24:36 George: "We were always kinda, y'know, a little nervous, before each step we went up the ladder. We were a little nervous but we always had that confidence." _(Jools - shush!)_

24:45 _The Morecambe and Wise Show_ **but now cut off at 26:06 before costume change** and so no _Moonlight Bay_.

26:06 George: "And that was the good thing about being four together, not like Elvis, which, y'know, I always felt sorry later for Elvis 'cause he was on his own, he had his guys with him, but, there was only one Elvis, nobody else knew what he felt like, but for us we all shared the experience."

26:30 Studio outtake and chatter from _What You're Doing_.

26:44 George Martin: "We had a great time in the studio. They were enormously happy times. And uh, they would fool around a lot, y'know, and have a bit of a laugh, particularly when overdubbing voices. But my memory of those times, were very happy ones.

26:57 Studio outtake and chatter from _This Boy_.

27:37 _This Boy_ (whole song, lip sync)

29:34 George: "We do like the fans and enjoy reading the publicity about us..." up to Ringo's "arrow in the brain" ending 31:39 _(Jools, begone!)_

31:40 _Long Tall Sally_ live performance on Swedish TV show, **cuts before awkward clapping exercise**.

33:01 Brian Matthew over footage of the Beatles returning from Sweden, up to Derek Taylor on Ringo's "perfect quote: want to play me drums for the Queen Mum."

33:58 John: "We were the first working-class singers, that stayed working-class, and pronounced it, didn't try and change our accents, which in England are looked - were looked down upon, probably still are."

34:11 John interviewed, "We're not going to vote for Ted", to Paul being interviewed while John pokes him in the back of the head.

34:51 Royal Variety Performance: edited down to just John's "cheaper seats" bit followed by _Twist and Shout_.

38:23 _It Won't Be Long_ (over animated _With The Beatles_ headshots)

38:35 George Martin: "_With the Beatles_ was the first, kind of put-together album of, first songbook, so to speak. And they gave me a list of their songs and they were all thinking in terms of singls still."

38:48 _I Wanna Be Your Man_ clip repeated, George Martin speaks over it

38:53 George Martin: "We weren't thinking of an album being an entity by itself. It was a collection of their songs, and I think one or two other people's songs as well."

39:00 George: "There was a bunch of cover versions on this, _Mister Postman_..."

39:04 _Please Mr. Postman_ lip sync begins

39:13 Ringo: "It was interesting when I joined the Beatles, we didn't really know each other, but if we looked at each other's record collection, the four of us virtually had the same records."

39:44 George Martin: "And all we did was to record singles, and the ones that weren't too good, we wouldn't issue as singles, we'd put them on an album. **[edit]**"

39:51 _All My Loving_ over animated _With The Beatles_ headshots

39:58 John: "In the early days we were really set on giving people their money's worth, and that was our policy at first, to put 14 tracks aside that was brand new and never put singles on the album, which everybody did was have a hit single and make an album round it."

40:16 _Roll over Beethoven_ (live TV performance)

40:34 George: "Robert freeman, who took this picture, copied our request actually, copied Astrid Kirchherr's photographs. We showed him the pictures we took in Hamburg with Astrid, and said 'Why can't you do it like this?'"

40:49 Brian Matthew reports on _With The Beatles_ breaking advance sales records

41:11 John: "**Y'know, our goal was to be as big as Elvis, but we didn't actually think we were gonna do it. We couldn't think in terms of going to America. I mean, that was like a dream. I mean, you think locally, and** first of all it was making it big in Liverpool, and being the best group in the county, y'know, then being the best group in England, and then we go up to Scotland and break them in, and things like that. And your goal was always, y'know, just a few yards ahead, rather than right up there."

41:33 Paul: "I think one of the cheekiest things we ever did was to say to Brian Epstein we're not going to America till we've got a number one. And the reason we did that, we'd seen a lot of people like, Adam Faith, Cliff Richard, British stars, quite big stars over in Britain, go over to America and be like, third or fourth on the bill to people like Frankie Avalon. **[edit]**"

41:53 Ringo: "George had been over there, to America, a little before we'd gone and nobody knew about us, and he came back and got us all worried, 'cause he'd gone into record shops saying 'Have you got the Beatles records?' and they'd say 'Who?'"

42:06 George: "And the EMI company wouldn't, which was Capitol, wouldn't put out our records for some reason. Somebody else may be able to fill us in on that, I don't know why."

42:16 George Martin: "**I would send them to my friends in America at Capitol Records, and say 'This group is fantastic. You've got to issue them and you've got to sell them in the States.' And each time the Head of Capitol Records, like St. Peter, would turn it down, and deny them, and say, 'Sorry. We know our market better than you do, and we don't think they're any good.'** So I would then take the record back from them and try and get it out with another label. And I did negotiations with Swan and with Vee-Jay, each of whom, just very tiny labels in the States, took one or the other titles, and they put those records out in America, and of course being small labels they didn't make a great deal of, um, success."

42:58 Paul: "And that was the way it worked out. We released _Please Please Me_ **[inserted quick blast of the track being performed live]** - flop. _From Me To You_ **[similarly inserted clip]** - flop. Changed record labels. **[_She Loves You_ clip]** Released _She Loves You_, they'd all been big hits in England, all been number one - all of them flops, nothing."

43:20 Studio outtake chatter, takes of _I Want To Hold Your Hand_ intro.

44:23 George Martin: "**_I Want To Hold Your Hand_** wasn't designed specifically for the American market, but like the ones before it, it was a great record."

44:29 _I Want to Hold Your Hand_ (lip sync, joined by George Martin and George in VO)

45:13 George Martin: "By this time the news from England and Europe was overwhelming that they were a hit group. **[edit]** And also, the Swan and Vee-Jay labels were making inroads, they were selling by this time. So Capitol were forced to release _I Wanna Hold Your Hand_."

45:29 George: "But at that time I didn't realise that Capitol Records had been told, y'know, you can, okay, they wanted to have The Beatles, you see. Then Brian Epstein said, okay, well you can have 'em then, on condition you spend $70,000 advertising them, which sounded enormous, but they did. So that was part of the deal, they had to promote us."

45:49 Paul: "The funny thing about France is it was boys screaming. **[edit]** It was boys. So we got 'Le Beatle! Le Beatle' (speaks in mock French) 'Paul! John!' It was like, 'Oui, yeah, okay', y'know, like, dear me."

46:20 George: "We had visions of all these French girls, y'know, "ooh la la" and all that, and instead, the audience, at least on the opening night, **[edit]** all seemed to be **[edit]** boys shouting 'Ringo! Ringo!' **We didn't see any of the Brigitte Bardot kind that we were expecting to see.**"

46:37 Ringo: "It was very strange because, uh, suddenly we had all these boys, **and the audience was like a roar instead of a scream,** and we'd been so used to the girls, y'know."

46:48 Paul: "I don't think we went down that well, but I think we built it over the few days, we kind of built it up, and eventually it was a bit of a success, y'know. But it wasn't quite what we were used to, we were used to a little bit more instant success than that."

47:11 Paul: "We got a telegram in the evening..." up to "Tell the boys there's a big crowd waiting for them there" at 50:20.

50:21 Brian Epstein: "[There was a turning point in their career. A specific date on which the breadth and scope of their future was to be altered. And it was the day their Pan-Am jet touched down at Kennedy International in New York to a welcome which has seldom been equalled anywhere in history.](#3&dvd5)" (Brought forward from early in Episode 3)
