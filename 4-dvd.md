00:34 Recreation of Beatles fan bedroom (black and white), Brian Matthew interview, scenes of chaos in America over their cover of Chuck Berry's _Rock and Roll Music_.

03:25 John: "We always call it the eye of the hurricane, y'know, it was calmer right in the middle."

03:30 _Rock and Roll Music_ continues for the last verse/chorus to the end

04:03 John: (at press conference) "All together I think it's 30 days."

04:05 Paul: (to an interviewer) "There's just more people here because they're bigger stadiums. We normally play in theatres in England."

04:10 Interviewer: "Haircuts, for instance..."

04:12 Ringo: "It's just happened, y'know. Just wake up one day and there you are."

04:16 John: (at press conference) "We wrote and we recorded and we play them every day. What do you rehearse? Smiling, that's all we rehearse."

04:22 George: (at press conference) "On this tour, we don't get much time to do anything."

04:25 John: (at another press conference) "I've just liked this kind of music for about eight years or since it came out. It's just good, y'know, good [Ringo speaks over him]."

04:32 _Rock and Roll Music_ ends a second time (not a second time?)

04:36 Ringo: "I loved it. I loved all the decoy cars and, y'know, all these intricate ways of getting us to the gigs."

04:44 Paul: "People say, 'Don't, doesn't it, drive you mad, all these girls screaming?' I'd say, no, but if you go to a football match, a big FA Cup final, you'll see old men going, 'ROAAR!' We say this is the girls' equivalent."

04:56 Ringo: "We did the same 30 minutes, 25. If we didn't like it, we played it fast."

05:02 George: "**Because you couldn't ever hear anything** and we were playing the repetition of all our singles mainly, y'know, just doing our hits. **And then we only played 20 minutes anyway.**"

05:13 Paul: "We never realised how fast we played when we were live. Because the adrenaline sometimes would just make you, y'know, instead of, _(sings normally)_ 'All my loving' _(sings frantically)_ 'All my loving.' Very fast, y'know. Very hyper on all the adrenaline and talking fast. 'Thank you.' On to the next song, y'know."

05:33 Paul introduces _All My Loving_ live at the Hollywood Bowl, we get the whole song with no interruptions.

07:46 John: "The Hollywood Bowl was pretty tatty, y'know. It's nice to hear. It'll probably go out one day, I'd have thought. But we're so nervous, y'know. It was like going on the Palladium."

07:56 George Martin: "**I wanted to have a live concert and** I arranged with Capital to provide their engineers and we recorded at Hollywood Bowl, but the techniques we had then in America was three-track half-inch. And the separation wasn't too great. To begin with, y'know, you had your voices in the center, but you had a mixture of drums and bass and guitars on your separate side tracks. But pervading the whole lot was the enormous welter of screams from the audience. I mean, it was like putting a microphone by the end of a 747 jet. It was just one continual screaming sound. And it was very difficult to get a good recording out of it with the techniques we had there. And in fact, Hollywood Bowl tapes weren't issued. They didn't think it was right to do so. And it wasn't until many years later that I dug them up and refurbished them and worked on them. And we did issue a record."

08:54 _She Loves You_ excerpt from Hollywood Bowl, up to Paul talking about meeting early idols, Little Richard, Fats Domino.

09:52 _The Times They Are A-Changin'_ Bob Dylan clip

09:57 Ringo: "He was one of them."

09:58 Paul: "He was our idol."

10:00 Ringo: "Bob was Bob was our hero."

10:03 George: "Not an idol but we just heard his record as I said we listened to his album and it really gave us a buzz and we played it constantly over and over and over again."

10:15 Ringo: "I mean I heard of Bob through John he played the records to me and it was just it was just great."

10:23 George: "I think it was _Freewheelin'_."

10:25 John: "We love Bob Dylan."

10:26 _A Hard Rain’s A‐Gonna Fall_ clip

10:51 George: "So when we met him yeah well y'know by that time we'd heard much more of him and we knew much more about him."

10:58 Paul: "It was great honour to meet him. We had a crazy party the night we met. **I went around...**"

11:04 Paul: "I thought I got the meaning to life that night... And I'd written: There are seven levels."

11:38 Ringo: "Well, there was two men in the room and Bob is the well-known one."

11:43 Paul: "Al Aronowitz was there, who's a journalist, who's like a mate."

11:48 Ringo: "That was the first time for me that I'd really smoked marijuana and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed. It was fabulous."

12:12 George Martin: "**I remember travelling with the boys and being almost kicked out of an aircraft by some reporters who wanted to get on. I remember being in a lift stuck between floors because too many people crowded in and being escorted by police cars and** it was just one giant three-ring circus from which there was no let-up."

12:31 George Martin: "The only peace they got was when they were alone in their hotel rooms hearing the screams outside **and watching television. Well that was about it. A hell of a life really.**"

12:42 George: "Yeah there was all kinds of stuff, y'know, we flew out of Montreal in order to avoid Ringo getting killed."

12:52 Ringo: "**We were playing Canada and they decided to make an example of me as an English Jew... one major fault is I'm not Jewish and I was, we were on, we were playing the gig and I,** y'know, I was always on a high riser..." up to "and this guy was just sitting there." [This anecdote has moved to episode 6.](#6&dplus10)

13:49 George: "**That kind of stuff was happening all the time, it was terrifying, and yeah,** some people would set up firecrackers in the hall and you'd think someone of the others got shot, or something."

14:05 John: "On stage I always feel safety, and when they break through, I don't know, it must be some kind of, y'know, I just feel as though I'm all right when I'm plugged in, and I don't feel as though they'll get me." _Significant slow fade, a few seconds silence_ [This quote has moved to episode 6.](#6&dplus12)

14:21 Paul: "If you look at any of those books that say where the Beatles were working... we were having to say, we've got to have a day off, man."

14:39 Neil Aspinall: "We didn't get any time off! Yeah, we seem to get five minutes off here and there. It might have been longer than that but it felt like five minutes, but... that was okay."

14:48 George Martin: "Well, I mean, wherever they went there were hordes of people trying to get hold of them, trying to get their autographs, trying to touch them, it was like, I mean everywhere they went they were brought cripples, by the way, y'know, I mean, they had, there was a sort of thing that went around, 'Look out, fellas, cripples coming,' and they'd wheel in all the paraplegics so they could touch them. It was like Jesus almost."

15:11 Derek Taylor: "There's no doubt there was a lot of opportunism, there were a lot of people pushing wheelchairs who were bonkers. The people in the wheelchairs were victims of whatever it was they got them in the wheelchair and also the prisoners of these people and that situation did become nightmarish."

15:32 Ringo: "There were some really bad cases, God help them, y'know, but there was really some poor little children that would be brought in, I mean some actual basket cases, I mean they were just in baskets, y'know, and also the some really just, just sad thalidomide kids."

15:59 George: "It's not very nice to be, y'know, afflicted but, y'know, John had this kind of thing that manifest as a, y'know, as, as a joke, he'd always joke about it because the reality was too much for him, I think, it was a fear or, y'know, something... _[laughs]_ you can see actually in all these home movies, every time, y'know, John, you switch a camera on and put him on, he does, goes into a spastic and his interpretation of what a spastic is."

16:32 Paul: "John would always do daft _[demonstrates, except he actually succeeds in clapping]_ daft clapping, y'know we couldn't really see ourselves as the sort of, 'Yeah, come on, get on,' it was all, _[pulls wacky faces]_ there's a lot of that, y'know, but it kept the sane, I think, y'know, a little bit of irreverent humor it, meant we weren't falling for the game too much."

16:54 Paul (at a live show): "It's dead easy, all you've gotta do is, sort of, clap your hands."

16:57 John repeats the instruction in his impression of a person with spasticity and bashes his clawed fingers together

17:07 Paul: "... stamp your feet on the floor."

17:09 John again repeats and demonstrates, before going into a shuffling dance

17:08 George: "**Y'know** even when we got away from the screaming fans there was all the screaming policemen, **and the Lord Mayors and wives and y'know the hotel managers and his entourage, it was**..."

17:30 George: "The only place we ever got any peace was when we got in the suite and went to the bathroom. Y'know, that was about the only place where you could have a bit of peace."

17:41 John: "We'll never do another tour like it, it could never be the same as this one. And y'know, it's probably something we'll remember for the rest of our days."

17:52 George: "So we were always just hit and run, really, we just nipped about very quickly and then we were back home."

17:58 _Slow Down_

18:05 Brian Matthew: "Today the Beatles returned from America where they played 32 shows in 34 days, in 24 different cities. But there's no rest for the boys. In two weeks they'll be back out on the road here in the UK."

18:26 George Martin: "John had mucked around with feedback... and it was his idea. It was great."

18:49 Paul: "I seem to remember that the... John and George had Everly Brothers Gibsons."

18:54 George: "Yeah, the, well, we had these big Gibson round sound-hole electric ones."

18:57 Paul: "We called them Everly Brothers, they looked like the Everly's had, had used, and they were, John put -"

19:03 George: "They were made to be Everly's, but -"

19:04 Paul: "John put... and so they were electric, they were acoustics, semi-electrics, they had electric facilities kind-of-thing, and Joh leaned his against the amp..." up to "... it probably was actually, y'know."

19:45 Paul: "Well y'know, once you see somebody messing with feedback, it's a whole field of research, innit? As it became later but I'm sure that's how it happened it wasn't engineered it came from the accident and then we made it something we could edit onto the front."

20:00 _I Feel Fine_ over a montage of clips.

22:10 Brian Matthew: "Funny chaps, who are they? Well maybe I'll find out as the show goes on," up to Paul: "We like the old numbers."

22:22 Brian Matthew: "All right well you pick one now that isn't your own to sing for us will you?"

22:58 Paul: "All right then... Kansas City."

23:00 _Kansas City_ initially over the reproduction bedroom, then fading to a live performance for the rest of the song. Then cuts to a live show in France where Paul shyly introduces the next number in French.

25:19 Paul: "Merci... Salut! Salut? _[audience applauds]_ Salut. Et maintenant... _[repeating himself quietly]_ maintenant, un chanson... chanson... qui s'appelle... _I'm A Loser_."

25:45 _I'm a Loser_ live, complete song.

28:09 George Martin: "One of the problems with all their concerts was that they couldn't hear themselves. Everyone's used to the, today, to the technology in great concerts. And everyone has a fold-back speaker at their feet so they can hear what's going on. Didn't have that in those days. So the, the three, y'know, John, Paul and George will be standing at microphones in front of a screaming crowd of 60,000. And Ringo will be at the back on the drums. And Ringo said to me, y'know, he said, it was very difficult following. He said, I couldn't do anything clever. I couldn't do great drum kicks or anything, or drum rolls or, or fills. So I just had to hang on to that back beat all the time to keep everybody together."

28:48 _Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby_ from the show in France, complete song.

31:03 Opening scene from _Help!_, the human sacrifice interrupted by Eleanor Bron pointing out the absent ring.

31:23 _Help!_ film opening title and song, discussion up to when the band falls backward into the snow.

33:28 _You're Gonna Lose That Girl_ scene from _Help!_

35:49 Producer character: "Boys, are you buzzing?"

35:51 Paul: "Well, I think, y'know, this was beginning to get into that period when people were sort of giving up the drink, which had been the sort of stimulant of the times, and were getting into the herbal jazz cigarettes. \*\*And it was changing things a bit, y'know, things were becoming a bit more imaginative, a little more crazy."

36:12 John: "By then we were smoking marijuana for breakfast at that period. And we were well into marijuana, and nobody could communicate with us, 'cause it was just four glazed eyes giggling all the time, y'know, in their own world."

36:22 George: "We had fun in those days."

36:24 Paul: "And I think that was one of the reasons for not learning the script. We just sort of showed up a bit stoned, y'know, and sort of smiled a lot and hoped we'd get through it."

36:32 Card game scene from _Help!_ beginning from Paul saying "Here y'are, cop this, one hand" up to Ringo saying "It appears I need one card..."

36:57 George: "It's difficult when four people all have to say lines, y'know, one behind the other..." up to John saying "We're not capable enough actors to make it any better than that."

38:45 _You've Got To Hide Your Love Away_ scene from _Help!_

40:54 Paul: "I know that we were searching 'round for a title, and that was always a kind of crucial thing to us, y'know, to get the titles good and that. And we'd had the _Hard Day's Night_ thing, which had been Ringo just making a mistake, y'know, the first time 'round, 'cause he's one of those blokes who jumbles words, not meaning to, and you get a great new phrase, y'know, that's better than the two he took the mixture from. So we were toying around with things like _Tomorrow Never Knows_, which was another of his which we ended up using as a song title, and then I remember us all sort of sitting around, trying to think of stuff, and I think John sort of went home and came up, I think he came up with... with Dick Lester, I think we came up with the idea of _Help!_, and then John went home and happened to write it that evening. Wait a minute! Hold on, that's wrong."

41:54 Paul: "John got the idea I think for the title _Help!_ and I think from things he said later, I think it was a bit his state of mind, He was feeling a bit constricted by the whole Beatle thing."

42:05 George: "He never said that when he wrote it. He said it retrospectively, that was how he was feeling. And that's why he wrote that. But he was kind of plump and, y'know, he has his, I think that's... he just didn't feel right, y'know."

42:23 Neil Aspinall: "**I think it was because he felt he was a bit, I think he called it his Elvis, fat Elvis period,** he got a bit podgy or something in his own eyes, and that was depressing him a bit. But I think John has done interviews and articles about that."

42:43 John: "I mean I go into these troughs every few years..." up to Paul reporting the others saying of _Yesterday_, "There's nothing we could add to it, so do it, y'know."

46:53 _Yesterday_'s TV debut from _Blackpool Night Out_

49:19 George Martin: "And I remember John listening to it..." up to Paul: "Y'know, we thought we were like a little R&B combo."

50:01 _I'm Down_ from _Blackpool Night Out_

50:41 _I Feel Fine_ from the NME show, starting from the guitar solo

51:34 _She's a Woman_ from the NME show

52:40 George Martin: "**And** George's songwriting was painful for him because he had no one to collaborate with. And John and Paul were such a sort of collaborative duo that they would throw out a word of advice to George and so on, but they didn't really work with him."

52:57 John: "Paul and I really carved up the empire between us" up to Ringo performing _Act Naturally_ live at Blackpool, complete song.

57:05 John: "Yeah, I liked it, 'cause it was slightly a new sound at the time. I used to like guitars, y'know. I don't want anything else on the album, with guitars and jangling, piano or whatever. And it's all happening, it's a heavy record, y'know."

57:21 _Ticket to Ride_ live at Blackpool, cutting to Twickenham promo from 58:50.

59:30 Interviewer: "George Harrison, M.B.E..." up to Paul: "We were honoured, genuinely."

01:00:16 George Harrison: "The lowest honour that you could possibly get."

01:00:19 Paul: "The cynicism started to creep in a little bit. And you said, 'Well, what do you get for it?' They said, 'Well, 40 pounds a year.' We said, 'Yeah.' They said, 'Well, and you can get to go into St. Paul's Whispering Gallery for nothing.' Yeah, I said, 'How much does it cost anyway?' And he was sort of like, about a shilling."

01:00:39 Ringo: "I can't really remember any sort of Daily Mirror reaction..." up to chap in the street saying "If I had the MBE, I think I should be slightly put out at being placed on the same level as a pop singer."

01:01:14 Lady with Scots twang: "I don't think it's a very good idea to return them. I can see the point in being rather surprised that people like the Beatles would be given the award."

01:01:24 Man with groovy beard: "Well, I think really it's a little ridiculous. Both sides have, well, one side has evaluated the honour too highly, and the other side I think too lowly."

01:01:32 Another man: "Well, this medal of the British Empire raises a question. What is the British Empire? Purely an honorary thing. You can give it to anyone you like. I don't think it's got any value at all."

01:01:41 Northern-English man: "I mean, someone always takes exception to someone else getting something."

01:01:44 Paul: "Most people were pleased."

01:01:47 Irish young woman: "Yes, I think it's a very good thing because I think they deserved it and they are great."

01:01:54 Old lady: "I think they deserved it."

01:01:57 Man with moustache: "I think the MBE anyway is a bit of a joke. Other sorts of people have got it in the past. I can't see any reason why the Beatles shouldn't have it."

01:02:02 Bald man: "I think they're great."

01:02:04 Paul: "I'm glad everyone's delighted."

01:02:06 Young man: "I think that they deserve everything they've got. They're very clever people. They're very clever actors."

01:02:11 Middle-aged lady: "To me, they're young, vital, and they give this country a kick and a lift. And my God, we need it."

01:02:18 Interviewer: "How do you feel, John, about having the MBE?"

01:02:20 John: "I feel great, y'know. We're honoured."

01:02:23 Ringo: "I thought it was really thrilling, but we're going to meet the Queen. We're going to give us a badge. So, yeah, this is cool."

01:02:33 American news reporter for ABC outside Buckingham Palace: "In days gone by, they used to storm the Royal Palace gates, demanding bread or the right to vote or some other civil right. These days, it's all for the Beatles. The mop-haired quartet received their MBEs from the Queen today. They're members of the British Empire."

01:02:49 _Eight Days a Week_ over footage of the day

01:03:44 Paul: "It was good fun. We ended up at the palace..." up Ringo: "I was too stoned to remember. I don't know."

01:05:53 George: "After all we did for Great Britain, selling all that corduroy and making it swing, and they just gave us that bloody old leather medal with wooden string through it..."
