00:34 Recreation of Beatles fan bedroom (now in colour), Brian Matthew interview, scenes of chaos in America over their cover of Chuck Berry's _Rock and Roll Music_. The start of the episode is identical in terms of content for several minutes (except for the usual cleaned up footage and slight timing differences in edits.)

03:37 John: "It was like being in the eye of a hurricane, and so there was never a time when... You thought, 'What's going on?' And that was about as deep as it got, 'What is happening?' or 'What...' You'd suddenly wake up in the middle of a concert or a happening, and think, how did I get here?"

03:50 _Rock and Roll Music_ jumps to the end abruptly

03:54 George: (at press conference) "On this tour, we don't get much time to do anything."

03:58 John: (at press conference) "We wrote and we recorded and we play them every day. What do you rehearse? Smiling, that's all we rehearse."

04:04 George Martin: "**[edit]** It was just one giant three-ring circus from which there was no let-up."

04:12 George: "Even when we got away from the screaming fans, there was all the screaming policemen."

04:17 George Martin: "The only peace they got was when they were alone in the hotel rooms, hearing the screams outside. **[edit]**"

04:26 George: "The only place we ever got any peace was when we got in the suite and went to the bathroom. Y'know, that was about the only place where you could have a bit of peace."

04:39 John: (at press conference) "All together I think it's 30 days."

04:42 Paul: (to an interviewer) "There's just more people here because they're bigger stadiums. We normally play in theatres in England."

04:47 Paul introduces _All My Loving_ live at the Hollywood Bowl

05:45 Ringo: "Because of the size of the audience and the volume of the noise, there was nothing else I could do through the numbers, bar play the offbeat, and as a musician y'know what that is, y'know _(mimes simple drumming)_, No matter what it was, I mean, I could only _[more miming]_, y'know, and trying to lip read where they were up to in the songs and try and read by their movements, y'know, from the back of John Paul and George, sometimes, where the hell we were up to in the song."

06:12 _All My Loving_ continues

06:26 Paul: "People say, 'Don't, doesn't it drive you mad, all these girls screaming?' We didn't mind it, y'know, because sometimes it covered, y'know, a multitude of sins. We were out of tune. It didn't matter, we couldn't hear it, nor could they, so it was handy some nights."

06:42 Paul: "We never realised how fast we played when we were live. Because the adrenaline sometimes would just make you, y'know, instead of, _(sings normally)_ 'All my loving' _(sings frantically)_ 'All my loving.' Very fast, y'know. Very hyper on all the adrenaline and talking fast. 'Thank you.' On to the next song, y'know."

07:02 George: "And we were playing the repetition of all our singles mainly, y'know, just doing our hits."

07:20 _All My Loving_ ends

07:27 John: "The Hollywood Bowl was pretty tatty, y'know. It's nice to hear. It'll probably go out one day, I'd have thought. But we're so nervous, y'know. It was like going on the Palladium."

07:37 George Martin: "**[edit]** I arranged with Capital to provide their engineers and we recorded at Hollywood Bowl, but the techniques we had then in America was three-track half-inch. And the separation wasn't too great. To begin with, y'know, you had your voices in the center, but you had a mixture of drums and bass and guitars on your separate side tracks. But pervading the whole lot was the enormous welter of screams from the audience. I mean, it was like putting a microphone by the end of a 747 jet. It was just one continual screaming sound. And it was very difficult to get a good recording out of it with the techniques we had there. And in fact, Hollywood Bowl tapes weren't issued. They didn't think it was right to do so."

08:23 Paul: "We listened to that back and we wouldn't let them release it. Years later George and Geoff Emerick, George Martin and Geoff Emerick did a lot of work on it."

08:31 George Martin: "And refurbished them and worked on them. And we did actually issue a record."

08:35 _She Loves You_ excerpt from Hollywood Bowl, up to Paul talking about meeting early idols, Little Richard, Fats Domino.

09:27 _A Hard Rain’s A‐Gonna Fall_ Bob Dylan clip

09:37 Ringo: "He was one of them."

09:38 Paul: "He was our idol."

09:40 George: "Not an idol, but we just heard his record. As I said, we listened to his album and it really gave us a buzz and we played it constantly over and over and over again."

09:52 George: "I think it was _Freewheelin'_."

09:54 John: "When I first met Dylan, that was pretty dumbfounded, y'know, that was back in New York. He thought, _I Want To Hold Your Hand_, was when it goes, 'I can't hide.', he was always singing, 'I get high,' you see, y'know, the biggest laugh all night forever. It's fantastic, y'know."

10:10 George: "So when we met him yeah well y'know by that time we'd heard much more of him and we knew much more about him."

10:16 Paul: "It was great honour to meet him. We had a crazy party the night we met. **[edit]**"

10:20 Ringo: "That was the first time for me that I'd really smoked marijuana and I laughed and I laughed and I laughed. It was fabulous."

10:32 Paul: "I thought I got the meaning to life that night... And I'd written: There are seven levels."

11:20 George: "One trip or another, we met Elvis. It was one of the highlights _[ironic laughter]_ of our visit." **Note: the entire Elvis story has been [moved back from Episode 5 to here](#5&dvd14), although that meeting occurred after the Shea Stadium concert that opens Episode 5. The structure and content is largely retained, with minor reordering, and the removal of Neil Aspinall's "We weren't buddies or anything, you know. But he was really nice, he was a nice guy, he was very slim and, you know, he was really good. I'm glad I met him."**

15:48 Brian Matthew: "Today the Beatles returned from America where they played 32 shows in 34 days, in 24 different cities. But there's no rest for the boys. In two weeks they'll be back out on the road here in the UK."

16:16 Paul: "If you look at any of those books that say where the Beatles were working.. we were having to say, we've got to have a day off, man."

16:34 Neil Aspinall: "We didn't get any time off! Yeah, we seem to get five minutes off here and there. It might have been longer than that but it felt like five minutes, but... that was okay."

16:45 George Martin: "John had mucked around with feedback... and it was his idea. It was great."

17:06 John: "That's me completely, including the guitar lick. I had this electric acoustic guitar and it would feed back."

17:15 Paul: "John and George had Everly Brothers Gibson's.

17:18 George: "Yeah, the, well, we had these big Gibson round sound-hole electric ones."

17:21 Paul: "We called them Everly Brothers, they looked like the Everly's had, had used, and John leaned his against the amp..." up to "... it probably was actually, y'know."

17:59 John: "And the little intro, which goes _[imitates the feedback hum and start of the riff]_ is the first feedback. I claim it for the Beatles."

18:05 _I Feel Fine_, the Twickenham promo video filmed a year after it came out. Edited to remove the guitar solo and last verse/chorus.

19:19 Brian Matthew: "Funny chaps, who are they? Well maybe I'll find out as the show goes on," up to Paul: "We like the old numbers."

20:06 _Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby_, brief excerpt over the reproduction bedroom.

20:15 George Martin: "It was only after the first year that they started getting really interested in studio techniques. They always wanted to get the thing right, so it wasn't a one-take operation. They would listen to it and they'd do two or three takes until they got it pretty well right."

20:28 Studio outtakes/chatter

20:34 _Honey Don't_ excerpt

20:50 George: "Things like _Honey Don't_ and _Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby,_ we'd played live so much, we just had to get a sound on that and just do it. But things like _Baby's in Black,_ well, that was like learn the songs and rehearse them, and I think we were beginning to do a little bit of overdubbing in those days. It's probably a four track."

21:08 Studio outtakes/chatter from a _Baby's in Black_ session

21:21 _Baby's In Black_ excerpt

21:33 Paul: "I used to go out to John's house in Weybridge to write songs. And at that particular time, I had been busted for speeding. So I had to have a driver to take me out there. And we were chatting on the way. I remember saying to the guy, 'Well, how you been? Y'know, you've been busy?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah, mate.' He said, 'I've been working eight days a week.' And then went into John's house and said, 'Right, I've got the title _Eight Days a Week_.' And we wrote it there and then."

22:01 _Eight Days a Week_ excerpt

22:08 Ringo: "The rehearsal would go on in the studio because from very early on, a lot of the songs weren't finished. The ideas were there for the songs or the first verse, or a chorus, but it could be changed by the writers as we were doing it."

22:23 Outtakes/chatter from a _No Reply_ session

22:39 Paul: "That is a rather nice cover. That's Robert Freeman, nice photos. We showed up in Hyde Park near the Albert Memorial. And I was quite impressed by George's hair there. It was a marvelous little turnip top he managed to create."

22:58 _Help!_ film opening title and song, discussion up to when the band falls backward into the snow.

25:04 Paul: "Well, I think, y'know, this was beginning to get into that period when people were sort of giving up the drink, which had been the sort of stimulant of the times, and were getting into the herbal jazz cigarettes."

25:17 George Martin: "I was 14 years older than they were, so. They knew... I guess I was straight, and they knew I'd disapprove very strongly of drugs. I'm afraid I used to smoke cigarettes, and that's pretty well as bad. So they never smoked pot in front of me. They used to just nip down to the canteen below, have a little drag, y'know, come out giggling a bit. I knew what they were doing, but it didn't make any difference."

26:00 _You're Gonna Lose That Girl_ scene from _Help!_

27:32 Producer character: "Boys, are you buzzing?"

27:35 John: "By then we were smoking marijuana for breakfast at that period. And we were well into marijuana, and nobody could communicate with us, 'cause it was just four glazed eyes giggling all the time, y'know, in their own world."

27:45 George: "We had fun in those days."

27:47 Paul: "I think that was one of the reasons for not learning the script. We just sort of showed up a bit stoned, y'know, and sort of smiled a lot and hoped we'd get through it."

36:32 Card game scene from _Help!_ beginning from Ringo saying "It appears I need one card..."

27:57 George: "It's difficult when four people all have to say lines, y'know, one behind the other..." up to John saying "We're not capable enough actors to make it any better than that."

29:48 George: "I had these two guys who used to write songs whenever we needed some. I think we just called them up and said, look, we'll be doing a movie now lads. Will you come up with a couple of catchy hits?"

29:58 Paul: "I would go out to Weybridge, where John was. I'd drive out myself. Wake him up mainly, y'know, he'd sort of wait till I got there and we'd have a cup of coffee or something. And then we'd just spend the afternoon, just two or three hours, sit up in the... he had a little room up at the top of the house, a little music room. And we just go and lock ourselves away in there, and just say, 'Okay, what have we got?' y'know."

30:23 Outtakes/chatter from _Ticket to Ride_

30:34 _Ticket to Ride_ final recording excerpt

31:13 Paul: "I think it was largely John's, the actual ticket to ride bit. We wrote it together."

31:18 John: "Yeah, I liked it, 'cause it was slightly a new sound at the time. I used to like guitars, y'know. I don't want anything else on the album, with guitars and jangling, piano or whatever. And it's all happening, it's a heavy record, y'know."

31:35 _Ticket to Ride_ Twickenham promo video excerpt

31:53 Paul: "You see, with John and I, certain songs would nearly always be the idea of one of us. One of us had actually said, 'Ticket to Ride,' and the other one said, "Okay, that's what we'll write today."

32:06 _Help_ Twickenham promo video excerpt

32:15 Paul: "John got the idea I think for the title _Help!_ and I think from things he said later, I think it was a bit his state of mind, He was feeling a bit constricted by the whole Beatle thing."

32:26 George: "He never said that when he wrote it. He said it retrospectively, that was how he was feeling. And that's why he wrote that. But he was kind of plump and, y'know, he has his, I think that's... he just didn't feel right, y'know."

42:23 Neil Aspinall: "**[edit]** He got a bit podgy or something in his own eyes, and that was depressing him a bit. But I think John has done interviews and articles about that."

32:55 John: "I mean I go into these troughs every few years..." up to Paul reporting the others saying of _Yesterday_, "There's nothing we could add to it, so do it, y'know."

37:03 George Martin: "And I remember John listening to it..." up to Paul: "Y'know, we thought we were like a little R&B combo."

37:47 _Yesterday_'s TV debut from _Blackpool Night Out_

40:11 George Martin: "Well, we got into the way now of every album we made, then we expected George to have a song, we expected Ringo to sing a song. It was a kind of, y'know, we'd try and include the boys in the group."

40:24 George Martin: "**[edit]** George's songwriting was painful for him because he had no one to collaborate with. And John and Paul were such a sort of collaborative duo that they would throw out a word of advice to George and so on, but they didn't really work with him."

40:41 Paul: "Because it was an option, y'know, to include George in the songwriting team. But without wanting to be too sort of mean to him, we had decided, I remember walking up through Woolton, past Woolton Church with John, just one sort of, one morning, and, y'know, going over this question, should three of us write, or would it be better just to keep it simple, y'know? And we decided, no, we'd just keep the two of us, y'know, at it. So George used to write his own songs."

41:07 _I Need You_ scene from _Help!_

41:23 John: "Paul and I really carved up the empire between us" up to Ringo performing _Act Naturally_ live, truncated.

44:11 Interviewer: "**Well, I find myself in distinguished company. And may I without more ado introduce,** George Harrison, M.B.E..." up to Paul: "We were honoured, genuinely."

45:01 American news reporter for ABC outside Buckingham Palace: "In days gone by, they used to storm the Royal Palace gates, demanding bread or the right to vote or some other civil right. These days, it's all for the Beatles. The mop-haired quartet received their MBEs from the Queen today. They're members of the British Empire."

45:16 _Eight Days a Week_ over footage of the day

45:38 Ringo: "I thought it was really thrilling, but we're going to meet the Queen. We're going to give us a badge. So, yeah, this is cool."

45:54 Paul: "It was good fun. We ended up at the palace..." up Ringo: "I was too stoned to remember. I don't know."

48:01 Ringo: "I can't really remember any sort of Daily Mirror reaction..." up to chap in the street saying "If I had the MBE, I think I should be slightly put out at being placed on the same level as a pop singer."

48:36 Paul: "I'm glad everyone's delighted."

48:38 Man with moustache: "I think the MBE anyway is a bit of a joke. Other sorts of people have got it in the past. I can't see any reason why the Beatles shouldn't have it."

48:45 Middle-aged lady: "To me, they're young, vital, and they give this country a kick and a lift. And my God, we need it."

48:52 Interviewer: "How do you feel, John, about having the MBE?"

48:54 John: "I feel great, y'know. We're honoured."

48:57 Interviewer: "What did your wife say when she knew you had it?"

48:59 Over still photo of John with Cynthia - John: "She said, 'Oh.' Cos she didn't have a clue what, really what it was either, but she's pleased, y'know. I tried to get her one, but she couldn't...

49:06 George: "After all we did for Great Britain, selling all that corduroy and making it swing, and they just gave us that bloody old leather medal with wooden string through it..."
