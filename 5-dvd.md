00:30 Ed Sullivan introduces the Beatles at Shea Stadium, they go into _Twist and Shout_

02:49 Paul introduces _I Feel Fine_

04:54 Ringo: "I never felt people came to hear our show, I felt they came to see us, because from the count-in on the first number, the volume of screams just drowned everything out."

05:33 George: "Vox made a special big amplifiers for that tour, and they were like 100 watts. We went up from the 30 watt amp to the 100 watt amp."

05:45 Neil Aspinall: "Yeah, that was mic'd up, I think, to the big speakers that they had around Shea Stadium. So the audience weren't necessarily listening to what was coming from the stage. They were listening to what was coming from the PA system, really."

06:00 Paul: "It was the baseball stadium's P.A., we were just working off the normal columns, which were _[mimes speaking through a loud hailer]_ 'Ladies and gentlemen, the next player is...' y'know, and our stuff is coming out of there. So it can't've sounded too good.

06:13 John introduces _Baby's In Black_ with some gibberish. At 06:35 he is about to say the song title but spots a pitch invader and points at her, saying "Aww, look at 'er..." After the song, up to Ringo: "I mean, I feel that on that show, John cracked up. I mean, just went mad, not mentally ill, I mean, just got crazy."

09:53 Ringo: "Y'know, if you see him. He's playing the electric piano with his elbows. And it was a really strange thing, you know?"

10:02 John: "We did _I'm Down,_ because I did the organ on the record... I was doing it for a laugh." Slowed-down footage of him playing the organ at Shea Stadium, treated to be black and white.

10:16 _I'm Down_, up to Paul: "I mean, now it's a kind of a big crowd, even, 56,000."

12:59 Paul: "But then it was, it's like old money, you know. It then seemed like millions of people."

13:05 Ringo: "You know, 60,000 people."

13:07 George: "Told me it was 70."

13:09 _Help_, complete song, and the Shea Stadium segment ends with no further commentary.

15:38 **Original location of the Elvis sequence, which in the Disney+ version has [moved to episode 4](#4&dplus33), even though it happened after the Shea Stadium concert.**

20:41 Ringo: "In '62, you know, we were touring in a van and people were laughing at us. I mean, you know, that's how our career started. They were laughing at us in Scotland and places like that. Then they got interested and then they got to really listen and like us and then this screaming thing started."

21:08 George: "They used us as an excuse to go mad. The world did, and then blamed it on us. And we were just in the middle of that, in a car or hotel room. We couldn't really do much. I mean, we couldn't go out, we couldn't, you know, couldn't do anything."

21:45 George: "It felt dangerous, you know, because everybody was out of hand and out of line. Even the cops were out of line, you know, they were all just caught up in the mania, you know, it was like they were in this big movie and it was like we were the ones trapped in the middle of it while everybody else was going mad. We were actually the sanest people in the whole thing."

22:08 Ringo: "The realization, you know, is really kicking in that nobody was listening. And that was okay at the beginning. But even worse than that is we were playing so bad."

22:19 Paul: "We're now a big band that when we went 'Woo!' and shook our heads, you know, everyone went mad."

22:26 Paul: "I personally, as I say, I don't really think it was that bad."

22:29 Ringo: "You know, I was playing it, just shit. And all I could do was just hold down the offbeat, 'cause, you know, I couldn't come off that really, because, you know, if you went to do anything on the toms, it just like went into nothing. _[Air-drums playing basic backbeat and then a fill that is silent.]_ There's no noise! And you just, you know, I just felt, you know, we're playing really bad."

22:56 Ringo: "And, you know, why I joined the Beatles was because they were the best band in Liverpool. And I always wanted to play with good players. That's what it was all about, you see. We were, first and foremost, we were musicians."

23:11 George Martin: "They'd shared no signs of flagging as far as their musical creativity was concerned. On the contrary, they were becoming more and more productive and the work they were giving me was much more interesting. They were finding new frontiers all the time."

23:27 Ringo: "Our whole attitude was changing. We'd grown up a little, I think grass was really influential in a lot of our changes. Especially with the writers, you know, so because they were writing different stuff, we were playing differently. **We were all, you know, expanding in all areas of our life, opening up to a lot of different attitudes.**"

24:01 Paul: "You know, the direction was just changing away from the sort of _Thank You Girl_ of the poppy stuff, you know, the early stuff, _From Me To You_, _She Loves You_. It was all really, the early stuff was directly relating to your fans, kind of, really, saying please buy this record. You know, _Thank You Girl_, _PS I Love You_. It was all very that. And I think, you know, it became a point where we thought we've done enough of that. We can branch out a little bit into songs that are a little bit more surreal, a little bit more entertaining."

24:33 Paul: "And other people were starting to arrive on the scene that were a little bit influential. And I don't know really whether we'd been influenced. I think Dylan was starting to influence us quite heavily at that point."

24:46 John: "When it got sort of contemporary, as it were, even if it was contemporary influence, I think _Rubber Soul_ was about when it started happening."

24:54 _Drive My Car_ excerpt over studio photos

25:13 _Nowhere Man_ excerpt over studio photos

25:21 Paul: "It was just around that period when we were all getting into various different kinds of music and George's became Indian. I think all of us were listening to sort of classical and various types of music other than our own and our rock-and-roll kind of roots. And George just sort of moved into the Indian thing. I think he'd give you a better explanation of just sort of when it was."

25:56 George: "**Well actually during the filming of 'Help' there was some Indian musicians in a restaurant scene and I kind of messed around with the sitar then. But** during that year, towards the end of that year anyway, I kept hearing the name of Ravi Shankar," up to "We just miked it up, and we put it on, and it just seemed to hit the spot."

27:25 _Norwegian Wood_ excerpt

28:20 George Martin: "They were getting more and more interested in unusual sounds, and, yes, I mean, they were trying out new instruments and always coming to me, saying, 'What ideas have you got for this?'"

28:34 George Martin: "_Yesterday_ had been a breakthrough. The first time we'd ever used other instrumentalists on the records. The only person who had ever played with them before was me, and now we had a group of other musicians. So we weren't averse to using other people or other sounds."

28:51 George Martin: "And Rubber Soul was an indication of the way things were going to go. It's one of my favourite albums. I think it's a great album."

28:57 George: "That was my favourite, you know, at that time. I think that was the best one we made. I mean, we certainly knew we were making a good album then."

29:07 Paul: "And the cover story, you know, the cover where we looked stretched, the photos stretched. That was the kind of thing that would happen then, which we were all very into that kind of random, little exciting thing that would happen. The photographer was Bob Freeman, and he'd taken some pictures around a John's house in Weybridge, and we just had our new gear on, the polo-necks, and we would do straight mug shots, four of us all posing. And he came back in London, he was in someone's flat, and he was showing us he had a little carousel of slides, and he had a piece of cardboard stuck up on a little chair that was album cover size, and he was projecting the photographs exactly onto it, because you can imagine exactly how it would have looked then as an album cover. It's just kind of a good way to do it. But just as we'd just chosen the photo, we said, "But that one looks good," and we all liked ourselves in one particular shot. And it was just winding up when the card it was on just fell backwards a little bit, and it elongated the photo, and it stretched, and we went, 'Oh, can we have that? Can you do it like that?' He said, 'Well, yeah, I can print it like that.' We said, 'Yes, that's it. _Rubber Soul_!'"

30:20 John: "You see, there's no great mysterious... meanings behind all of this. It was just four boys, you know, working out what to call their new album."

30:29 George: "I don't see too much difference myself in _Rubber Soul_ and _Revolver_. To me, they could both be like volume one and volume two. **Maybe I'm wrong. I haven't played them right back to back of each other, but** they both were very pleasant and enjoyable records for me."

30:56 Ringo: "I mean, it has that quality because it's the follow-on and we were just starting, I feel, to really find ourselves in the studio, you know, what we could do, which was, you know, over just being the thought of us playing our instruments and the vocals."

31:15 George Martin: "And their ideas now were beginning to become much more potent in the studio and they would start telling me what they wanted, and they would start pressing me for more ideas **and more ways of translating those ideas into reality.**"

31:30 Ringo: "We'd be well into the album, and we all knew that, you know, I'd be doing a number somewhere. It's just about three quarters of the way through, so we'd either say, "Have you got a song, you know, we've got this for you."

31:47 Paul: "**I thought it might not be a bad idea, you know, for him, rather than trying to give him a very serious song, you know, because he wasn't that keen on singing. So the idea came up to do that, and** I just remember lying in bed, just that moment before you're going to sleep, that little twilight moment, when silly ideas come into your head anyway. And then I just thought of this thing, Yellow Submarine, yeah, you know."

32:12 _Yellow Submarine_ movie clips blended with home movies of the Beatles on vacation, the animated characters appearing to interact with the live action people, e.g. a Blue Meanie kicks John into the pool.

33:09 Ringo: "By then I'd started writing myself," up to George: "... a heavy penalty to pay for making money."

35:10 George Martin: "And it was on Revolver that, of course, we have the track _Tomorrow Never Knows_, which was a great innovation."

35:18 John: "That's me in my Tibetan book of the dead period. And the expression _Tomorrow Never Knows_ is another of Ringo's. I gave it a throwaway title because I was a bit self-conscious about the lyrics of _Tomorrow Never Knows_, so I took one of Ringo's malapropisms, which was like _Hard Day's Night_, and sort of to take the edge off the heavy philosophical lyrics."

35:41 Paul: "John had this song which was all on the chord of C... Suddenly this was just John just strumming on C rather earnestly, **and, you know, 'Lay down your mind, existence...'**"

36:22 _Tomorrow Never Knows_, up to _Nowhere Man_ live in Munich, complete song.

39:20 George: "Somewhere between albums and tours there was a day where I had a dentist... And then before you knew where you were suddenly it was all crazy."

42:05 Paul: "But I really was frightened of that kind of stuff... and I think John was rather excited by that prospect. I was rather frightened by that prospect, **just what I need, you know, there's gonna be some funny little thing where I can never get back home again. You know, oh geez, you know, maybe not the greatest move.**"

42:38 Paul: "So I delayed and I was seen to sort of stall a little bit, I think, within the group, you know, 'cause there was a lot of peer pressure. I mean talk about peer pressure - the Beatles."

43:02 _Day Tripper_, complete song, cutting between clips from several TV lip-sync appearances.

44:46 John: "'Cause it was a _Day Tripper_, you know, that was a drug song. I just liked the word."

45:04 Brian Matthews: "Seeing as how this show's the last Saturday Club..." up to "I'm putting it on now and here goes the needle on the record... Now."

46:47 _We Can Work It Out_, complete song, cutting between two different lip-sync performances, one with them wearing black roll-neck sweaters and the other in their Shea Stadium gear.

48:51 George: "Well, the mania, you know, was, as we've talked about, was pretty difficult to get around..." up to Ringo in the clip for Ed Sullivan: "And one's called _Rain_ and one's called _Paperback Writer_."

50:52 _Paperback Writer_ over the promo film, essentially the whole thing.

52:58 George: "So I mean that was the idea. We'd send them to America also because we thought well we can't go everywhere. We'll send these things out to promote the record. And obviously like these days now everybody does that. It's just part of your promotion for a single. So I suppose in a way we invented MTV."

53:29 _Rain_ promo, again, most of the song.

55:46 John: "That's the first record with backwards music on it."

56:20 _Got To Get You Into My Life_ begins

56:59 George: "This is a thing which we never really talked about, but everywhere we were going in these days it was a demonstration of one thing or another, it was, you know, riots were happening. Plus people were demonstrating because the Budokan was supposed to be a special spiritual hall and only reserved for martial arts."

57:24 Reporter at news conference: "Some Japanese say that your performances will violate the Budokan, which is devoted to traditional Japanese martial arts, and you've set a bad example for Japanese youth by leading them astray from traditional Japanese values. What do you think of all that?"

57:40 Paul: "The thing is that if somebody from Japan, if a dancing troupe from Japan goes to Britain, nobody tries to say in Britain that they're violating the traditional laws,
y'know, or trying to spoil anything. All we're doing is coming here and singing because we've been asked to."

57:56 John: "It's better to watch singing than wrestling anyway."

57:59 Paul: "We're not trying to violate anything and we're just as traditional anyway."

58:05 Ringo: "But you know in any town we went to someone always had a grievance. Something was wrong."

58:14 Paul: "We were locked up in the hotel for a long time with various merchants coming around..." up to George: "At 5.35 we'll be down in the car park."

59:37 Paul: "Then they said, 'You will get in car with Mr Evans.' We had the seating arranged in all the cars. It was like amazing efficiency we'd never seen the like of in Britain."

59:46 Ringo: "Just to be how we were, they would knock on the door and we wouldn't never come out. They would just totally wreck their timings and you'd see all these guys. They were absolutely barmy as we hadn't walked down the corridor at 7:14 and a third, you know. But we knew we were doing that to them."

01:00:09 Paul: "So as we went to the gig, they had the fans organised with police patrols on each corner..." up to the Budokan concert introduction.

01:01:55 _Rock and Roll Music_, live at the Budokan, complete song.

01:03:33 Paul: "The close harmonies on things like _Paperback Writer_..." up to George: "You know, there was way of doing it on stage, really."

01:04:15 _Paperback Writer_, live at the Budokan, first minute in which Paul's microphone annoyingly keeps rotating away and he has to adjust it back.

01:05:05 George: "We'd get to the point where it was particularly bad... the screaming did cover a lot of worrying moments."

01:05:26 Neil Aspinall: "Yeah, the scream used to cover a multitude of sins, right? And now, at those shows, it wasn't there, **right? And so, the second show was pretty good. They got it together by then, but the first one, it was a bit of a shock.**"

01:05:40 Ringo: "You mean we actually played better in the 30 minutes we had?"

01:05:43 Neil Aspinall: "Yeah, I guess so."

01:05:46 Ringo: "Well, that's probably true."

01:05:48 _Yesterday_ live at the Budokan, complete song.

01:07:52 Ringo: "I think it just started to hit everybody. I mean, I remember we had one meeting and we were just mainly talking about... the musicianship was going downhill, never mind the boredom of doing it, you know? I mean, there was always so much more pressure from the minute you opened your eyes, people trying to get at you, you know, for whatever reason, you know, to be friends or to get an interview or to do a radio. I mean, the pressure was on from the minute you started."

01:08:42 _A brief trailer for the Philippines sequence that starts episode 6 in the DVDs, but which is moved to the end of this episode in the Disney+ version._
